first

he
is
widely
considered

in

of

and
western
philosophy
along
with
his
teacher
socrates
and
his
most
famous
student
aristotle
plato
has
also
often
been
cited
as
one
of
founders
of
western
religion
and
spirituality
the
socalled

noted
safest
general
characterization
of

philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes
to
plato
plato
was
innovator
of
written
dialogue
and
dialectic
forms
in
philosophy
plato
is
also
considered
founder
of
western
political
philosophy
his
most
famous
contribution
is
theory
of
forms
known
by
pure
reason
in
which
plato
presents
solution
to
problem
of
universals
known
as
platonism
also
ambiguously
called
either
platonic
realism
or
platonic
idealism
he
is
also
namesake
of
platonic
love
and
platonic
solids
his
own
most
decisive
philosophical
influences
are
usually
thought
to
have
been
along
with
socrates
presocratics
pythagoras
heraclitus
and
parmenides
although

of

predecessors

early
life
of
plato
birth
and
family
diogenes
laertius
is
principal
source
for
history
of
ancient
greek
philosophy
due
to
lack
of
surviving
accounts
little
is
known
about
platos
early
life
and
education
plato
belonged
to
aristocratic
and
influential
family
according
to
disputed
tradition
reported
by
doxographer
diogenes
lartius
platos
father
ariston
traced
his
descent
from
king
of
athens
codrus
and
king
of
messenia
melanthus
according
to
ancient
hellenic
tradition
codrus
was
said
to
have
been
descended
from
mythological
deity
poseidon
through
his
mother
plato
was
related
to
solon
platos
mother
was
perictione
whose
family
boasted
of
relationship
with
famous
athenian
lawmaker
and
lyric
poet
solon
one
of
seven
sages
who
repealed
laws
of
draco
except
for
death
penalty
for
homicide
perictione
was
sister
of
charmides
and
niece
of
critias
both
prominent
figures
of
thirty
tyrants
known
as
thirty
brief
oligarchic
regime
bc
which
followed
on
collapse
of
athens
at
end
of
peloponnesian
war
bc
according
to
some
accounts
ariston
tried
to
force
his
attentions
on
perictione
but
failed
in
his
purpose
then
god
apollo
appeared
to
him
in
vision
and
as
result
ariston
left
perictione
unmolested
the
exact
time
and
place
of
platos
birth
are
unknown
based
on
ancient
sources
most
modern
scholars
believe
that
he
was
born
in
athens
or
aeginac
between
and
bc
not
long
after
start
of
peloponnesian
ward
the
traditional
date
of
platos
birth
during
th
or
th
olympiad
or
bc
is
based
on
dubious
interpretation
of
diogenes
lartius
who
says
when
socrates
was
gone
plato
joined
cratylus
heracleitean
and
hermogenes
who
philosophized
in
manner
of
parmenides
then
at
twentyeight
hermodorus
says
plato
went
to
euclides
in
megara
however
as
debra
nails
argues
text
does
not
state
that
plato
left
for
megara
immediately
after
joining
cratylus
and
hermogenes
in
his
seventh
letter
plato
notes
that
his
coming
of
age
coincided
with
taking
of
power
by
thirty
remarking
but
youth
under
age
of
twenty
made
himself
laughingstock
if
he
attempted
to
enter
political
arena
thus
nails
dates
platos
birth
to
according
to
neanthes
plato
was
six
years
younger
than
isocrates
and
therefore
was
born
same
year
prominent
athenian
statesman
pericles
died
bc
jonathan
barnes
regards
bc
as
year
of
platos
birth
the
grammarian
apollodorus
of
athens
in
his
chronicles
argues
that
plato
was
born
in
th
olympiad
both
suda
and
sir
thomas
browne
also
claimed
he
was
born
during
th
olympiad
another
legend
related
that
when
plato
was
infant
bees
settled
on
his
lips
while
he
was
sleeping
augury
of
sweetness
of
style
in
which
he
would
discourse
about
philosophy
speusippus
was
platos
nephew
besides
plato
himself
ariston
and
perictione
had
three
other
children
two
sons
adeimantus
and
glaucon
and
daughter
potone
mother
of
speusippus
nephew
and
successor
of
plato
as
head
of
academy
the
brothers
adeimantus
and
glaucon
are
mentioned
in
republic
as
sons
of
ariston
and
presumably
brothers
of
plato
though
some
have
argued
they
were
unclese
in
scenario
in
memorabilia
xenophon
confused
issue
by
presenting
glaucon
much
younger
than
plato
ariston
appears
to
have
died
in
platos
childhood
although
precise
dating
of
his
death
is
difficult
perictione
then
married
pyrilampes
her
mothers
brother
who
had
served
many
times
as
ambassador
to
persian
court
and
was
friend
of
pericles
leader
of
democratic
faction
in
athens
pyrilampes
had
son
from
previous
marriage
demus
who
was
famous
for
his
beauty
perictione
gave
birth
to
pyrilampes
second
son
antiphon
halfbrother
of
plato
who
appears
in
parmenides
in
contrast
to
his
reticence
about
himself
plato
often
introduced
his
distinguished
relatives
into
his
dialogues
or
referred
to
them
with
some
precision
in
addition
to
adeimantus
and
glaucon
in
republic
charmides
has
dialogue
named
after
him
and
critias
speaks
in
both
charmides
and
protagoras
these
and
other
references
suggest
considerable
amount
of
family
pride
and
enable
us
to
reconstruct
platos
family
tree
according
to
burnet
opening
scene
of
charmides
is
glorification
of
whole
family
connection
platos
dialogues
are
not
only
memorial
to
socrates
but
also
happier
days
of
his
own
family
name
the
fact
that
philosopher
in
his
maturity
called
himself
platon
is
indisputable
but
origin
of
this
name
remains
mysterious
platon
is
nickname
from
adjective
plats
broad
although
platon
was
fairly
common
name
instances
are
known
from
athens
alone
name
does
not
occur
in
platos
known
family
line
the
sources
of
diogenes
lartius
account
for
this
by
claiming
that
his
wrestling
coach
ariston
of
argos
dubbed
him
broad
on
account
of
his
chest
and
shoulders
or
that
plato
derived
his
name
from
breadth
of
his
eloquence
or
his
wide
forehead
while
recalling
moral
lesson
about
frugal
living
seneca
mentions
meaning
of
platos
name
his
very
name
was
given
him
because
of
his
broad
chest
plato
was
wrestler
his
true
name
was
supposedly
aristocles
meaning
best
reputationf
according
to
diogenes
lartius
he
was
named
after
his
grandfather
as
was
common
in
athenian
society
but
there
is
only
one
inscription
of
aristocles
early
archon
of
athens
in
bc
there
is
no
record
of
line
from
aristocles
to
platos
father
ariston
recently
scholar
has
argued
that
even
name
aristocles
for
plato
was
much
later
invention
however
another
scholar
claims
that
there
is
good
reason
for
not
dismissing
idea
that
aristocles
was
platos
given
name
as
mere
invention
of
his
biographers
noting
how
prevalent
that
account
is
in
our
sources
education
ancient
sources
describe
him
as
bright
though
modest
boy
who
excelled
in
his
studies
apuleius
informs
us
that
speusippus
praised
platos
quickness
of
mind
and
modesty
as
boy
and
first
fruits
of
his
youth
infused
with
hard
work
and
love
of
study
his
father
contributed
all
which
was
necessary
to
give
to
his
son
good
education
and
therefore
plato
must
have
been
instructed
in
grammar
music
and
gymnastics
by
most
distinguished
teachers
of
his
time
plato
invokes
damon
many
times
in
republic
plato
was
wrestler
and
dicaearchus
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
plato
wrestled
at
isthmian
games
plato
had
also
attended
courses
of
philosophy
before
meeting
socrates
he
first
became
acquainted
with
cratylus
and
heraclitean
doctrines
ambrose
believed
that
plato
met
jeremiah
in
egypt
and
was
influenced
by
his
ideas
augustine
initially
accepted
this
claim
but
later
rejected
it
arguing
in
the
city
of
god
that
plato
was
born
hundred
years
after
jeremiah

own
statement
was
that
he
visited
italy
and
sicily
at
age
of
forty
and
was
disgusted
by
sensuality
of
life
there
said
to
have
returned
to
athens
at
age
of
forty
plato
founded
one
of
earliest
known
organized
schools
in
western
civilization
on
plot
of
land
in
grove
of
hecademus
or
academus
this
land
was
named
after
academus
attic
hero
in
greek
mythology
in
historic
greek
times
it
was
adorned
with
oriental
plane
and
olive
plantations
the
academy
was
large
enclosure
of
ground
about
six
stadia
total
of
between
kilometer
and
half
mile
outside
of
athens
proper
one
story
is
that
name
of
academy
comes
from
ancient
hero
academus
still
another
story
is
that
name
came
from
supposed
former
owner
of
plot
of
land
athenian
citizen
whose
name
was
also
academus
while
yet
another
account
is
that
it
was
named
after
member
of
army
of
castor
and
pollux
arcadian
named
echedemus
the
academy
operated
until
it
was
destroyed
by
lucius
cornelius
sulla
in
bc
many
intellectuals
were
schooled
in
academy
most
prominent
one
being
aristotle
throughout
his
later
life
plato
became
entangled
with
politics
of
city
of
syracuse
according
to
diogenes
lartius
plato
initially
visited
syracuse
while
it
was
under
rule
of
dionysius
during
this
first
trip
dionysiuss
brotherinlaw
dion
of
syracuse
became
one
of
platos
disciples
but
tyrant
himself
turned
against
plato
plato
almost
faced
death
but
he
was
sold
into
slaveryg
anniceris
cyrenaic
philosopher
subsequently
bought
platos
freedom
for
twenty
minas
and
sent
him
home
after
dionysiuss
death
according
to
platos
seventh
letter
dion
requested
plato
return
to
syracuse
to
tutor
dionysius
ii
and
guide
him
to
become
philosopher
king
dionysius
ii
seemed
to
accept
platos
teachings
but
he
became
suspicious
of
dion
his
uncle
dionysius
expelled
dion
and
kept
plato
against
his
will
eventually
plato
left
syracuse
dion
would
return
to
overthrow
dionysius
and
ruled
syracuse
for
short
time
before
being
usurped
by
calippus
fellow
disciple
of
plato
according
to
seneca
plato
died
at
age
of
on
same
day
he
was
born
the
suda
indicates
that
he
lived
to
years
while
neanthes
claims
age
of
a
variety
of
sources
have
given
accounts
of
his
death
one
story
based
on
mutilated
manuscript
suggests
plato
died
in
his
bed
whilst
young
thracian
girl
played
flute
to
him
another
tradition
suggests
plato
died
at
wedding
feast
the
account
is
based
on
diogenes
lartiuss
reference
to
account
by
hermippus
thirdcentury
alexandrian
according
to
tertullian
plato
simply
died
in
his
sleep
plato
owned
estate
at
iphistiadae
which
by
will
he
left
to
certain
youth
named
adeimantus
presumably
younger
relative
as
plato
had
elder
brother
or
uncle
by
this
name
influences
pythagoras
bust
of
pythagoras

rome
although
socrates
influenced

directly
as
related
in
dialogues
influence
of
pythagoras
upon
plato
or
in
broader
sense
pythagoreans
such
as
archytas
also
appears
to
have
been
significant
aristotle
claimed
that
philosophy
of
plato
closely
followed
teachings
of
pythagoreans
and
cicero
repeats
this
claim
they
say
plato
learned
all
things
pythagorean
it
is
probable
that
both
were
influenced
by
orphism
and
both
believed
in
metempsychosis
transmigration
of
soul
pythagoras
held
that
all
things
are
number
and
cosmos
comes
from
numerical
principles
he
introduced
concept
of
form
as
distinct
from
matter
and
that
physical
world
is
imitation
of
eternal
mathematical
world
these
ideas
were
very
influential
on
heraclitus
parmenides
and
plato
george
karamanolis
notes
that
numenius
accepted
both
pythagoras
and
plato
as
two
authorities
one
should
follow
in
philosophy
but
he
regarded
platos
authority
as
subordinate
to
that
of
pythagoras
whom
he
considered
to
be
source
of
all
true
philosophyincluding
platos
own
for
numenius
it
is
just
that
plato
wrote
so
many
philosophical
works
whereas
pythagoras
views
were
originally
passed
on
only
orally
according
to
r
m
hare
this
influence
consists
of
three
points
the
platonic
republic
might
be
related
to
idea
of
tightly
organized
community
of
likeminded
thinkers
like
one
established
by
pythagoras
in
croton
the
idea
that
mathematics
and
generally
speaking
abstract
thinking
is
secure
basis
for
philosophical
thinking
as
well
as
for
substantial
theses
in
science
and
morals
they
shared
mystical
approach
to
soul
and
its
place
in
material
world
plato
and
mathematics
plato
may
have
studied
under
mathematician
theodorus
of
cyrene
and
has
dialogue
named
for
and
whose
central
character
is
mathematician
theaetetus
while
not
mathematician
plato
was
considered
accomplished
teacher
of

of

greatest
mathematician
in

who
contributed
much
of
what
is
found
in

was
taught
by

plato
helped
to
distinguish
between
pure
and

by
widening
gap
between

plato
associated
each
of
four
classical
elements
earth
air
water
and
fire
with
regular
solid
cube
octahedron
icosahedron
and
tetrahedron
respectively
due
to
their
shape

platonic
solids
the
fifth
regular
solid

was
supposed
to
be

heraclitus
and
parmenides
the
two
philosophers
heraclitus
and
parmenides
following
way
initiated
by
presocratic
greek
philosophers
like
pythagoras
depart
from
mythology
and
begin
metaphysical
tradition
that
strongly
influenced
plato
and
continues
today

the
surviving
fragments
written
by
heraclitus
suggest
view
that
all
things
are
continuously
changing
or
becoming
his
image
of
river
with
everchanging
waters
is
well
known
according
to
some
ancient
traditions
like
that
of
diogenes
lartius
plato
received
these
ideas
through
heraclitus
disciple
cratylus
who
held
more
radical
view
that
continuous
change
warrants
scepticism
because
we
cannot
define
thing
that
does
not
have
permanent
nature
parmenides
adopted
altogether
contrary
vision
arguing
for
idea
of
changeless
being
and
view
that
change
is
illusion

parmenides
distinction
among
principal
modes
of
being
and
his
derivation
of
attributes
that
must
belong
to
what
must
be
simply
as
such
qualify
him
to
be
seen
as
founder
of
metaphysics
or
ontology
as
domain
of
inquiry
distinct
from
theology
these
ideas
about
change
and
permanence
or
becoming
and
being
influenced
plato
in
formulating
his
theory
of
forms
platos
most
selfcritical
dialogue
is
called
parmenides
featuring
parmenides
and
his
student
zeno
who
following
parmenides
denial
of
change
argued
forcefully
with
his
paradoxes
to
deny
existence
of
motion
platos
sophist

includes
eleatic
stranger

of
parmenides
as
foil
for

arguments
against
parmenides
in

plato
distinguishes
nouns
and
verbs
providing
some
of
earliest
treatment
of
subject
and

he
also
argues
that
motion

both
are

was
one
of
devoted
young
followers
of
socrates
the
precise
relationship
between
plato
and
socrates
remains
area
of
contention
among
scholars
plato
never
speaks
in
his
own
voice
in
his
dialogues
and
speaks
as
socrates
in
all
but
laws
in
second
letter
it
says
no
writing
of
plato
exists
or
ever
will
exist
but
those
now
said
to
be
his
are
those
of
socrates
become
beautiful
and
new
if
letter
is
platos
final
qualification
seems
to
call
into
question
dialogues
historical
fidelity
in
any
case
xenophons

and
aristophaness
the
clouds
seem
to
present
somewhat
different
portrait
of
socrates
from
one
plato
paints
the
socratic
problem
asks
how
to
reconcile
these
various
accounts
leo
strauss
notes
that
socrates
reputation
for
irony
casts
doubt
on
whether
platos
socrates
is
expressing
sincere
beliefs
aristotle
attributes
different
doctrine
with
respect
to
forms
to
plato
and
socrates
aristotle
suggests
that
socrates
idea
of
forms
can
be
discovered
through
investigation
of
natural
world
unlike
platos
forms
that
exist
beyond
and
outside
ordinary
range
of
human
understanding
in
dialogues
of
plato
though
socrates
sometimes
seems
to
support
mystical
side
discussing
reincarnation
and
mystery
religions
this
is
generally
attributed
to
platoclarification
needed
regardless
this
view
of
socrates
cannot
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
as
we
cannot
be
sure
of
differences
between
views
of
plato
and
socrates
in
meno
plato
refers
to
eleusinian
mysteries
telling
meno
he
would
understand
socratess
answers
better
if
he
could
stay
for
initiations
next
week
it
is
possible
that
plato
and
socrates
took
part
in
eleusinian
mysteries
philosophy
metaphysics
in
platos
dialogues
socrates
and
his
company
of
disputants
had
something
to
say
on
many
subjects
including
several
aspects
of
metaphysics
these
include
religion
and
science
human
nature
love
and
sexuality
more
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
perception
and
reality
nature
and
custom
and
body
and
soul
the
forms
the
windmill
proof
of
pythagorean
theorem
found
in
euclids
elements
platonism
and
its
theory
of
forms
or
theory
of
ideas
denies
reality
of
material
world
considering
it
only
image
or
copy
of
real
world
the
theory
of
forms
is
first
introduced
in
phaedo
dialogue
also
known
as
on
soul
wherein
socrates
refutes
pluralism
of
likes
of
anaxagoras
then
most
popular
response
to
heraclitus
and
parmenides
while
giving
opposites
argument
in
support
of
forms
according
to
this
theory
of
forms
there
are
at
least
two
worlds
apparent
world
of
concrete
objects
grasped
by
senses
which
constantly
changes
and
unchanging
and
unseen
world
of
forms
or
abstract
objects
grasped
by
pure
reason
which
ground
what
is
apparent
it
can
also
be
said
there
are
three
worlds
with
apparent
world
consisting
of
both
world
of
material
objects
and
of
mental
images
with
third
realm
consisting
of
forms
thus
though
there
is
term
platonic
idealism
this
refers
to
platonic
ideas
or
forms
and
not
to
some
platonic
kind
of
idealism
thcentury
view
which
sees
matter
as
unreal
in
favour
of
mind
for
plato
though
grasped
by
mind
only
forms
are
truly
real
platos
forms
thus
represent
types
of
things
as
well
as
properties
patterns
and
relations
to
which
we
refer
as
objects
just
as
individual
tables
chairs
and
cars
refer
to
objects
in
this
world
tableness
chairness
and
carness
as
well
as
e
g
justice
truth
and
beauty
refer
to
objects
in
another
world
one
of
platos
most
cited
examples
for
forms
were
truths
of
geometry
such
as
pythagorean
theorem
in
other
words
forms
are
universals
given
as
solution
to
problem
of
universals
or
problem
of
one
and
many
e
g
how
one
predicate
red
can
apply
to
many
red
objects
for
plato
this
is
because
there
is
one
abstract
object
or
form
of
red
redness
itself
in
which
several
red
things
participate
as
platos
solution
is
that
universals
are
forms
and
that
forms
are
real
if
anything
is
platos
philosophy
is
unambiguously
called
platonic
realism
according
to
aristotle
platos
best
known
argument
in
support
of
forms
was
one
over
many
argument
what
is
justice
aside
from
being
immutable
timeless
changeless
and
one
over
many
forms
also
provide
definitions
and
standard
against
which
all
instances
are
measured
in
dialogues
socrates
regularly
asks
for
meaning
in
sense
of
intensional
definitions
of
general
term
e
g
justice
truth
beauty
and
criticizes
those
who
instead
give
him
particular
extensional
examples
rather
than
quality
shared
by
all
examples
there
is
thus
world
of
perfect
eternal
and
changeless
meanings
of
predicates
forms
existing
in
realm
of
being
outside
of
space
and
time
and
imperfect
sensible
world
of
becoming
subjects
somehow
in
state
between
being
and
nothing
that
partakes
of
qualities
of
forms
and
is
its
instantiation
the
soul
plato
advocates
belief
in
immortality
of
soul
and
several
dialogues
end
with
long
speeches
imagining
afterlife
in
timaeus
socrates
locates
parts
of
soul
within
human
body
reason
is
located
in
head
spirit
in
top
third
of

and
appetite
in

epistemology
socrates
such
as
wisdom
also
discuss
several
aspects
of
epistemology
more
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
knowledge
and
opinion
platos
epistemology
involves
socrates
arguing
that
knowledge
is
not
empirical
and
that
it
comes
from
divine
insight
the
forms
are
also
responsible
for
both
knowledge
or
certainty
and
are
grasped
by
pure
reason
in
several
dialogues
socrates
inverts
common
mans
intuition
about
what
is
knowable
and
what
is
real
reality
is
unavailable
to
those
who
use
their
senses
socrates
says
that
he
who
sees
with
his
eyes
is
blind
while
most
people
take
objects
of
their
senses
to
be
real
if
anything
is
socrates
is
contemptuous
of
people
who
think
that
something
has
to
be
graspable
in
hands
to
be
real
in
theaetetus
he
says
such
people
are
eu
amousoi
expression
that
means
literally
happily
without
muses
in
other
words
such
people
are
willingly
ignorant
living
without
divine
inspiration
and
access
to
higher
insights
about
reality
in
platos
dialogues
socrates
always
insists
on
his
ignorance
and
humility
that
he
knows
nothing
so
called
socratic
irony
several
dialogues
refute
series
of
viewpoints
but
offer
no
positive
position
of
its
own
ending
in
aporia
recollection
in
several
of
platos
dialogues
socrates
promulgates
idea
that
knowledge
is
matter
of
recollection
of
state
before
one
is
born
and
not
of
observation
or
study
keeping
with
theme
of
admitting
his
own
ignorance
socrates
regularly
complains
of
his
forgetfulness
in
meno
socrates
uses
geometrical
example
to
expound
platos
view
that
knowledge
in
this
latter
sense
is
acquired
by
recollection
socrates
elicits
fact
concerning
geometrical
construction
from
slave
boy
who
could
not
have
otherwise
known
fact
due
to
slave
boys
lack
of
education
the
knowledge
must
be
present
socrates
concludes
in
eternal
nonexperiential
form
in
other
dialogues
sophist
statesman
republic
and
parmenides
plato
himself
associates
knowledge
with
apprehension
of
unchanging
forms
and
their
relationships
to
one
another
which
he
calls
expertise
in
dialectic
including
through
processes
of
collection
and
division
more
explicitly
plato
himself
argues
in
timaeus
that
knowledge
is
always
proportionate
to
realm
from
which
it
is
gained
in
other
words
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
experientially
because
world
of
sense
is
in
flux
views
therein
attained
will
be
mere
opinions
and
opinions
are
characterized
by
lack
of
necessity
and
stability
on
other
hand
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
by
way
of
nonsensible
forms
because
these
forms
are
unchanging
so
too
is
account
derived
from
them
that
apprehension
of
forms
is
required
for
knowledge
may
be
taken
to
cohere
with
platos
theory
in
theaetetus
and
meno
indeed
apprehension
of
forms
may
be
at
base
of
account
required
for
justification
in
that
it
offers
foundational
knowledge
which
itself
needs
no
account
thereby
avoiding
infinite
regression
justified
true
belief
a
venn
diagram
illustrating
classical
theory
of
knowledge
many
have
interpreted
plato
as
statingeven
having
been
first
to
writethat
knowledge
is
justified
true
belief
influential
view
that
informed
future
developments
in
epistemology
this
interpretation
is
partly
based
on
reading
of
theaetetus
wherein
plato
argues
that
knowledge
is
distinguished
from
mere
true
belief
by
knower
having
account
of
object
of
their
true
belief
and
this
theory
may
again
be
seen
in
meno
where
it
is
suggested
that
true
belief
can
be
raised
to
level
of
knowledge
if
it
is
bound
with
account
as
to
question
of
why
object
of
true
belief
is
so
many
years
later
edmund
gettier
famously
demonstrated
problems
of
justified
true
belief
account
of
knowledge
that
modern
theory
of
justified
true
belief
as
knowledge
which
gettier
addresses
is
equivalent
to
platos
is
accepted
by
some
scholars
but
rejected
by
others
plato
himself
also
identified
problems
with
justified
true
belief
definition
in
theaetetus
concluding
that
justification
or
account
would
require
knowledge
of
difference
meaning
that
definition
of
knowledge
is
circular
ethics
several
dialogues
discuss
ethics
including
virtue
and
vice
pleasure
and
pain
crime
and
punishment
and
justice
and
medicine
plato
views
the
good
as
supreme
form
somehow
existing
even
beyond
being
socrates
propounded
moral
intellectualism
which
claimed
nobody
does
bad
on
purpose
and
to
know
what
is
good
results
in
doing
what
is
good
that
knowledge
is
virtue
in
protagoras
dialogue
it
is
argued
that
virtue
is
innate
and
cannot
be
learned
socrates
presents
famous
euthyphro
dilemma
in
dialogue
of
same
name
is
pious
loved
by
gods
because
it
is
pious
or
is
it

a
justice
as
above
in
republic
plato
asks
question
what
is
justice
by
means
of
greek
term
dikaiosune
term
for
justice
that
captures
both
individual
justice
and
justice
that
informs
societies
plato
is
able
not
only
to
inform
metaphysics
but
also
ethics
and
politics
with
question
what
is
basis
of
moral
and
social
obligation
platos
wellknown
answer
rests
upon
fundamental
responsibility
to
seek
wisdom
wisdom
which
leads
to
understanding
of
form
of
good
plato
further
argues
that
such
understanding
of
forms
produces
and
ensures
good
communal
life
when
ideally
structured
under
philosopher
king
in
society
with
three
classes
philosophers
kings
guardians
and
workers
that
neatly
mirror
his
triadic
view
of
individual
soul
reason
spirit
and
appetite
in
this
manner
justice
is
obtained
when
knowledge
of
how
to
fulfill
ones
moral
and
political
function
in
society
is
put
into
practice
politics
oxyrhynchus
papyri
with
fragment
of
platos
republic
the
dialogues
also
discuss
politics
some
of
platos
most
famous
doctrines
are
contained
in
republic
as
well
as
in
laws
and
statesman
because
these
doctrines
are
not
spoken
directly
by
plato
and
vary
between
dialogues
they
cannot
be
straightforwardly
assumed
as
representing
platos
own
views
socrates
asserts
that
societies
have
tripartite
class
structure
corresponding
to
appetitespiritreason
structure
of
individual
soul
the
appetitespiritreason
are
analogous
to
castes
of
society
productive
workers
labourers
carpenters
plumbers
masons
merchants
farmers
ranchers
etc
these
correspond
to
appetite
part
of
soul
protective
warriors
or
guardians
those
who
are
adventurous
strong
and
brave
in
armed
forces
these
correspond
to
spirit
part
of
soul
governing
rulers
or
philosopher
kings
those
who
are
intelligent
rational
selfcontrolled
in
love
with
wisdom
well
suited
to
make
decisions
for
community
these
correspond
to
reason
part
of
soul
and
are
very
few
according
to
this
model
principles
of
athenian
democracy
as
it
existed
in
his
day
are
rejected
as
only
few
are
fit
to
rule
instead
of
rhetoric
and
persuasion
socrates
says
reason
and
wisdom
should
govern
as
socrates
puts
it
until
philosophers
rule
as
kings
or
those
who
are
now
called
kings
and
leading
men
genuinely
and
adequately
philosophize
that
is
until
political
power
and
philosophy
entirely
coincide
while
many
natures
who
at
present
pursue
either
one
exclusively
are
forcibly
prevented
from
doing
so
cities
will
have
no
rest
from
evils
nor
i
think
will
human
race
socrates
describes
these
philosopher
kings
as
those
who
love
sight
of
truth
and
supports
idea
with
analogy
of
captain
and
his
ship
or
doctor
and
his
medicine
according
to
him
sailing
and
health
are
not
things
that
everyone
is
qualified
to
practice
by
nature
a
large
part
of
republic
then
addresses
how
educational
system
should
be
set
up
to
produce
these
philosopher
kings
in
addition
ideal
city
is
used
as
image
to
illuminate
state
of
ones
soul
or
will
reason
and
desires
combined
in
human
body
socrates
is
attempting
to
make
image
of
rightly
ordered
human
and
then
later
goes
on
to
describe
different
kinds
of
humans
that
can
be
observed
from
tyrants
to
lovers
of
money
in
various
kinds
of
cities
the
ideal
city
is
not
promoted
but
only
used
to
magnify
different
kinds
of
individual
humans
and
state
of
their
soul
however
philosopher
king
image
was
used
by
many
after
plato
to
justify
their
personal
political
beliefs
the
philosophic
soul
according
to
socrates
has
reason
will
and
desires
united
in
virtuous
harmony
a
philosopher
has
moderate
love
for
wisdom
and
courage
to
act
according
to
wisdom
wisdom
is
knowledge
about
good
or
right
relations
between
all
that
exists
wherein
it
concerns
states
and
rulers
socrates
asks
which
is
better
bad
democracy
or
country
reigned
by
tyrant
he
argues
that
it
is
better
to
be
ruled
by
bad
tyrant
than
by
bad
democracy
since
here
all
people
are
now
responsible
for
such
actions
rather
than
one
individual
committing
many
bad
deeds
this
is
emphasised
within
republic
as
socrates
describes
event
of
mutiny
on
board
ship
socrates
suggests
ships
crew
to
be
in
line
with
democratic
rule
of
many
and
captain
although
inhibited
through
ailments
tyrant
socrates
description
of
this
event
is
parallel
to
that
of
democracy
within
state
and
inherent
problems
that
arise
according
to
socrates
state
made
up
of
different
kinds
of
souls
will
overall
decline
from
aristocracy
rule
by
best
to
timocracy
rule
by
honourable
then
to
oligarchy
rule
by
few
then
to
democracy
rule
by

aristocracy
in
sense
of
government
politeia
is
advocated
in
platos
republic
this
regime
is
ruled
by
philosopher
king
and
thus
is
grounded
on
wisdom
and
reason
the
aristocratic
state
and
man
whose
nature
corresponds
to
it
are
objects
of
platos
analyses
throughout
much
of
republic
as
opposed
to
other
four
types
of
statesmen
who
are
discussed
later
in
his
work
in
book
viii

states
in

of

of

oligarchy
is

in
which

is

of

and
wealthy
are
in

in

state
bears
resemblance
to
ancient
athens
with
traits
such
as
equality
of
political
opportunity
and
freedom
for
individual
to
do
as
he
likes
democracy
then
degenerates
into
tyranny
from
conflict
of
rich
and
poor
it
is
characterized
by
undisciplined
society
existing
in
chaos
where
tyrant
rises
as
popular
champion
leading
to
formation
of
his
private
army
and
growth
of
oppression
art
and
poetry
several
dialogues
tackle
questions
about
art
including
rhetoric
and
rhapsody
socrates
says
that
poetry
is
inspired
by
muses
and
is
not
rational
he
speaks
approvingly
of
this
and
other
forms
of
divine
madness
drunkenness
eroticism
and
dreaming
in
phaedrus
and
yet
in
republic
wants
to
outlaw
homers
great
poetry
and
laughter
as
well
in
ion
socrates
gives
no
hint
of
disapproval
of
homer
that
he
expresses
in
republic
the
dialogue
ion
suggests
that
homers
iliad
functioned
in
ancient
greek
world
as
bible
does
today
in
modern
christian
world
as
divinely
inspired
literature
that
can
provide
moral
guidance
if
only
it
can
be
properly
interpreted
unwritten
doctrines
bust
excavated
at
villa
of
papyri
possibly
of
dionysus
plato
or
poseidon
for
long
time
platos
unwritten
doctrines
had
been
controversial
many
modern
books
on
plato
seem
to
diminish
its
importance
nevertheless
first
important
witness
who
mentions
its
existence
is
aristotle
who
in
his
physics
writes
it
is
true
indeed
that
account
he
gives
there
ie
in
timaeus
of
participant
is
different
from
what
he
says
in
his
socalled
unwritten
teachings
the
term
literally
means
unwritten
doctrines
or
unwritten
dogmas
and
it
stands
for
most
fundamental
metaphysical
teaching
of
plato
which
he
disclosed
only
orally
and
some
say
only
to
his
most
trusted
fellows
and
which
he
may
have
kept
secret
from
public
the
importance
of
unwritten
doctrines
does
not
seem
to
have
been
seriously
questioned
before
th
century
a
reason
for
not
revealing
it
to
everyone
is
partially
discussed
in
phaedrus
where
plato
criticizes
written
transmission
of
knowledge
as
faulty
favouring
instead
spoken
logos
he
who
has
knowledge
of
just
and
good
and
beautiful
will
not
when
in
earnest
write
them
in
ink
sowing
them
through
pen
with
words
which
cannot
defend
themselves
by
argument
and
cannot
teach
truth
effectually
the
same
argument
is
repeated
in
platos
seventh
letter
every
serious
man
in
dealing
with
really
serious
subjects
carefully
avoids
writing
in
same
letter
he
writes
i
can
certainly
declare
concerning
all
these
writers
who
claim
to
know
subjects
that
i
seriously
study
there
does
not
exist
nor
will
there
ever
exist
any
treatise
of
mine
dealing
therewith
such
secrecy
is
necessary
in
order
not
to
expose
them
to
unseemly
and
degrading
treatment
it
is
however
said
that
plato
once
disclosed
this
knowledge
to
public
in
his
lecture
on
good
in
which
good
is
identified
with
one
unity
fundamental
ontological
principle
the
content
of
this
lecture
has
been
transmitted
by
several
witnesses
aristoxenus
describes
event
in
following
words
each
came
expecting
to
learn
something
about
things
that
are
generally
considered
good
for
men
such
as
wealth
good
health
physical
strength
and
altogether
kind
of
wonderful
happiness
but
when
mathematical
demonstrations
came
including
numbers
geometrical
figures
and
astronomy
and
finally
statement
good
is
one
seemed
to
them
i
imagine
utterly
unexpected
and
strange
hence
some
belittled
matter
while
others
rejected
it
simplicius
quotes
alexander
of
aphrodisias
who
states
that
according
to
plato
first
principles
of
everything
including
forms
themselves
are
one
and
indefinite
duality
which
he
called
large
and
small
and
simplicius
reports
as
well
that
one
might
also
learn
this
from
speusippus
and
xenocrates
and
others
who
were
present
at
platos
lecture
on
good
their
account
is
in
full
agreement
with
aristotles
description
of
platos
metaphysical
doctrine
in
metaphysics
he
writes
now
since
forms
are
causes
of
everything
else
he
ie
plato
supposed
that
their
elements
are
elements
of
all
things
accordingly
material
principle
is
great
and
small
ie
dyad
and
essence
is
one
since
numbers
are
derived
from
great
and
small
by
participation
in
one
from
this
account
it
is
clear
that
he
only
employed
two
causes
that
of
essence
and
material
cause
for
forms
are
cause
of
essence
in
everything
else
and
one
is
cause
of
it
in
forms
he
also
tells
us
what
material
substrate
is
of
which
forms
are
predicated
in
case
of
sensible
things
and
one
in
that
of
formsthat
it
is
this
duality
dyad
great
and
small
further
he
assigned
to
these
two
elements
respectively
causation
of
good
and
of
evil
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
interpretation
of
platos
metaphysics
is
continuity
between
his
teaching
and
neoplatonic
interpretation
of
plotinusi
or
ficinoj
which
has
been
considered
erroneous
by
many
but
may
in
fact
have
been
directly
influenced
by
oral
transmission
of
platos
doctrine
a
modern
scholar
who
recognized
importance
of
unwritten
doctrine
of
plato
was
heinrich
gomperz
who
described
it
in
his
speech
during

international
congress
of

sources

that

socrates
famously
denies
being
wise
and
explains
how
his
life
as
philosopher
was
launched
by
oracle
at
delphi
he
says
that
his
quest
to
resolve
riddle
of
oracle
put
him
at
odds
with
his
fellow
man
and
that
this
is
reason
he
has
been
mistaken
for
menace
to
citystate
of
athens
in
apology
socrates
is
presented
as
mentioning
plato
by
name
as
one
of
those
youths
close
enough
to
him
to
have
been
corrupted
if
he
were
in

guilty
of
corrupting

and
questioning
why
their
fathers

brothers
did
not
step
forward
to
testify
against
him
if
he
was
indeed
guilty
of
such
crime

all

are

in

examples
of
characters

dialogues

the
protagoras

largest
gathering
of
socratic
associates
in

plato
is
most
celebrated
and
admired
for
socrates
is
concerned
with
human
and
political
virtue
has
distinctive
personality
and
friends
and
enemies
who
travel
with
him
from
dialogue
to
dialogue
this
is
not
to
say
that
socrates
is
consistent
man
who
is
his
friend
in
one
dialogue
may
be
adversary
or
subject
of
his
mockery
in
another
for
example
socrates
praises
wisdom
of
euthyphro
many
times
in
cratylus
but
makes
him
look
like
fool
in
euthyphro
he
disparages
sophists
generally
and
prodicus
specifically
in
apology
whom
he
also
slyly
jabs
in
cratylus
for
charging
hefty
fee
of
fifty
drachmas
for
course
on
language
and
grammar
however
socrates
tells
theaetetus
in
his
namesake
dialogue
that
he
admires
prodicus
and
has
directed
many
pupils
to
him
socrates
ideas
are

among

allegories
main
article
allegorical
interpretations
of
plato
mythos
and
logos
are
terms
that
evolved
along
classical
greek
history
in
times
of
homer
and
hesiod
th
century
bc
they
were
essentially
synonyms
and
contained
meaning
of
tale
or
history
later
came
historians
like
herodotus
and
thucydides
as
well
as
philosophers
like
heraclitus
and
parmenides
and
other
presocratics
who
introduced
distinction
between
both
terms
mythos
became
more
nonverifiable
account
and
logos
rational
account
it
may
seem
that
plato
being
disciple
of
socrates
and
strong
partisan
of
philosophy
based
on
logos
should
have
avoided
use
of
mythtelling
instead
he
made
abundant
use
of
it
this
fact
has
produced
analytical
and
interpretative
work
in
order
to
clarify
reasons
and
purposes
for
that
use
plato
in
general
distinguished
between
three
types
of
mythl
first
there
were
false
myths
like
those
based
on
stories
of
gods
subject
to
passions
and
sufferings
because
reason
teaches
that
god
is
perfect
then
came
myths
based
on
true
reasoning
and
therefore
also
true
finally
there
were
those
non
verifiable
because
beyond
of
human
reason
but
containing
some
truth
in
them
regarding
subjects
of
platos
myths
they
are
of
two
types
those
dealing
with
origin
of
universe
and
those
about
morals
and
origin
and
fate
of
soul
it
is
generally
agreed
that
main
purpose
for
plato
in
using
myths
was
didactic
he
considered
that
only
few
people
were
capable
or
interested
in
following
reasoned
philosophical
discourse
but
men
in
general
are
attracted
by
stories
and
tales
consequently
then
he
used
myth
to
convey
conclusions
of
philosophical
reasoning
some
of
platos
myths
were
based
in
traditional
ones
others
were
modifications
of
them
and
finally
he
also
invented
altogether
new
myths
notable
examples
include
story
of
atlantis
myth
of
er
and
allegory
of
cave
the
cave
platos
allegory
of
cave
by
jan
saenredam
according
to
cornelis
van
haarlem
albertina
vienna
the
theory
of
forms
is
most
famously
captured
in
his
allegory
of
cave
and
more
explicitly
in
his
analogy
of
sun
and
divided
line
the
allegory
of
cave
is
paradoxical
analogy
wherein
socrates
argues
that
invisible
world
is
most
intelligible
noeton
and
that
visible
world
horaton
is
least
knowable
and
most
obscure
socrates
says
in
republic
that
people
who
take
sunlit
world
of
senses
to
be
good
and
real
are
living
pitifully
in
den
of
evil
and
ignorance
socrates
admits
that
few
climb
out
of
den
or
cave
of
ignorance
and
those
who
do
not
only
have
terrible
struggle
to
attain
heights
but
when
they
go
back
down
for
visit
or
to
help
other
people
up
they
find
themselves
objects
of
scorn
and
ridicule
according
to
socrates
physical
objects
and
physical
events
are
shadows
of
their
ideal
or
perfect
forms
and
exist
only
to
extent
that
they
instantiate
perfect
versions
of
themselves
just
as
shadows
are
temporary
inconsequential
epiphenomena
produced
by
physical
objects
physical
objects
are
themselves
fleeting
phenomena
caused
by
more
substantial
causes
ideals
of
which
they
are
mere
instances
for
example
socrates
thinks
that
perfect
justice
exists
although
it
is
not
clear
where
and
his
own
trial
would
be
cheap
copy
of
it
the
allegory
of
cave
is
intimately
connected
to
his
political
ideology
that
only
people
who
have
climbed
out
of
cave
and
cast
their
eyes
on
vision
of
goodness
are
fit
to
rule
socrates
claims
that
enlightened
men
of
society
must
be
forced
from
their
divine
contemplation
and
be
compelled
to
run
city
according
to
their
lofty
insights
thus
is
born
idea
of
philosopherking
wise
person
who
accepts
power
thrust
upon
him
by
people
who
are
wise
enough
to
choose
good
master
this
is
main
thesis
of
socrates
in
republic
that
most
wisdom
masses
can
muster
is
wise
choice
of
ruler
ring
of
gyges
a
ring
which
could
make
one
invisible
ring
of
gyges
is
proposed
in
republic
by
character
of
glaucon
and
considered
by
rest
of
characters
for
its
ethical
consequences
whether
individual
possessing
it
would
be
most
happy
abstaining
or
doing
injustice
chariot
he
also
compares
soul
psyche
to
chariot
in
this
allegory
he
introduces
triple
soul
which
composed
of
charioteer
and
two
horses
the
charioteer
is
symbol
of
intellectual
and
logical
part
of
soul
logistikon
and
two
horses
represents
moral
virtues
thymoeides
and
passionate
instincts
epithymetikon
respectively
to
illustrate
conflict
between
them
dialectic
socrates
employs
dialectic
method
which
proceeds
by
questioning
the
role
of
dialectic
in
platos
thought
is
contested
but
there
are
two
main
interpretations
type
of
reasoning
and
method
of
intuition
simon
blackburn
adopts
first
saying
that
platos
dialectic
is
process
of
eliciting
truth
by
means
of
questions
aimed
at
opening
out
what
is
already
implicitly
known
or
at
exposing
contradictions
and
muddles
of
opponents
position
a
similar
interpretation
has
been
put
forth
by
louis
hartz
who
suggests
that
elements
of
dialectic
are
borrowed
from
hegel
according
to
this
view
opposing
arguments
improve
upon
each
other
and
prevailing
opinion
is
shaped
by
synthesis
of
many
conflicting
ideas
over
time
each
new
idea
exposes
flaw
in
accepted
model
and
epistemological
substance
of
debate
continually
approaches
truth
hartzs
is
teleological
interpretation
at
core
in
which
philosophers
will
ultimately
exhaust
available
body
of
knowledge
and
thus
reach
end
of
history
karl
popper
on
other
hand
claims
that
dialectic
is
art
of
intuition
for
visualising
divine
originals
forms
or
ideas
of
unveiling
great
mystery
behind
common
mans
everyday
world
of
appearances
family
plato
often
discusses
fatherson
relationship
and
question
of
whether
fathers
interest
in
his
sons
has
much
to
do
with
how
well
his
sons
turn
out
in
ancient
athens
boy
was
socially
located
by
his
family
identity
and
plato
often
refers
to
his
characters
in
terms
of
their
paternal
and
fraternal
relationships
socrates
was
not
family
man
and
saw
himself
as
son
of
his
mother
who
was
apparently
midwife
a
divine
fatalist
socrates
mocks
men
who
spent
exorbitant
fees
on
tutors

thirtyfive
dialogues
and
thirteen
letters

have
traditionally
been
ascribed
to
plato
though
modern
scholarship
doubts
authenticity
of
at
least
some
of
these
platos
writings
have
been
published
in
several
fashions
this
has
led
to
several
conventions
regarding
naming
and
referencing
of
platos
texts
the
usual
system
for
making
unique
references
to
sections
of
text
by
plato
derives
from
thcentury
edition
of
platos
works
by
henricus
stephanus
known
as
stephanus
pagination
one
tradition
regarding
arrangement
of
platos
texts
is
according
to
tetralogies
this
scheme
is
ascribed
by
diogenes
lartius
to
ancient
scholar
and
court
astrologer
to
tiberius
named
thrasyllus

platos
dialogues
were
written
in
nor
extent
to
which
some
might
have
been
later
revised
and
rewritten
the
works
are
usually
grouped
into
early
sometimes
by
some
into
transitional
middle
and
late
period
this
choice
to
group
chronologically
is
thought
worthy
of
criticism
by
some
cooper
et
al
given
that
it
is
recognized
that
there
is
no
absolute
agreement
as
to
true
chronology
since
facts
of
temporal
order
of
writing
are
not
confidently
ascertained
chronology
was
not
consideration
in
ancient
times
in
that
groupings
of
this
nature
are
virtually
absent
tarrant
in
extant
writings
of
ancient
platonists
whereas
those
classified
as
early
dialogues
often
conclude
in
aporia
socalled
middle
dialogues
provide
more
clearly
stated
positive
teachings
that
are
often
ascribed
to
plato
such
as
theory
of
forms
the
remaining
dialogues
are
classified
as
late
and
are
generally
agreed
to
be
difficult
and
challenging
pieces
of
philosophy
this
grouping
is
only
one
proven
by
stylometric
analysis
among
those
who
classify
dialogues
into
periods
of
composition
socrates
figures
in
all
of
early
dialogues
and
they
are
considered
most
faithful
representations
of
historical
socrates
the
following
represents
one
relatively
common
division
it
should
however
be
kept
in
mind
that
many
of
positions
in
ordering
are
still
highly
disputed
and
also
that
very
notion
that
platos
dialogues
can
or
should
be
ordered
is
by
no
means
universally
accepted
increasingly
in
most
recent
plato
scholarship
writers
are
sceptical
of
notion
that
order
of
platos
writings
can
be
established
with
any
precision
though
platos
works
are
still
often
characterized
as
falling
at
least
roughly
into
three
groups
early
apology
charmides
crito
euthyphro
gorgias
lesser
hippias
minor
greater
hippias
major

laches

late
critias
sophist

politicus
timaeus
philebus
laws
a
significant
distinction
of
early
plato
and
later
plato
has
been
offered
by
scholars
such
as
er
dodds
and
has
been
summarized
by
harold
bloom
in
his
book
titled
agon
er
dodds
is
classical
scholar
whose
writings
most
illuminated
hellenic
descent
in
the
greeks
and
irrational
in
his
chapter
on
plato
and
irrational
soul
dodds
traces
platos
spiritual
evolution
from
pure
rationalist
of
protagoras
to
transcendental
psychologist
influenced
by
pythagoreans
and
orphics
of
later
works
culminating
in
laws
lewis
campbell
was
first
to
make
exhaustive
use
of
stylometry
to
prove
great
probability
that
critias
timaeus
laws
philebus
sophist
and
statesman
were
all
clustered
together
as
group
while
parmenides
phaedrus
republic
and
theaetetus
belong
to
separate
group
which
must
be
earlier
given
aristotles
statement
in
his
politics
that
laws
was
written
after
republic
cf
diogenes
lartius
lives
what
is
remarkable
about
campbells
conclusions
is
that
in
spite
of
all
stylometric
studies
that
have
been
conducted
since
his
time
perhaps
only
chronological
fact
about
platos
works
that
can
now
be
said
to
be
proven
by
stylometry
is
fact
that
critias
timaeus
laws
philebus
sophist
and
statesman
are
latest
of
platos
dialogues
others
earlier
protagoras
is
often
considered
one
of
last
of
early
dialogues
three
dialogues
are
often
considered
transitional
or
premiddle
euthydemus
gorgias
and
meno
proponents
of
dividing
dialogues
into
periods
often
consider
parmenides
and
theaetetus
to
come
late
in
middle
period
and
be
transitional
to
next
as
they
seem
to
treat
theory
of
forms
critically
parmenides
or
only
indirectly
theaetetus
ritters
stylometric
analysis
places
phaedrus
as
probably
after
theaetetus
and
parmenides
although
it
does
not
relate
to
theory
of
forms
in
same
way
the
first
book
of
republic
is
often
thought
to
have
been
written
significantly
earlier
than
rest
of
work
although
possibly
having
undergone
revisions
when
later
books
were
attached
to
it
while
looked
to
for
platos
mature
answers
to
questions
posed
by
his
earlier
works
those
answers
are
difficult
to
discern
some
scholars
indicate
that
theory
of
forms
is
absent
from
late
dialogues
its
having
been
refuted
in
parmenides
but
there
isnt
total
consensus
that
parmenides
actually
refutes
theory
of
forms
writings
of
doubted
authenticity
jowett
mentions
in
his
appendix
to
menexenus
that
works
which
bore
character
of
writer
were
attributed
to
that
writer
even
when
actual
author
was
unknown
for
below
if
there
is
no
consensus
among
scholars
as
to
whether
plato

the
most
famous
criticism
of
theory
of
forms
is
third
man
argument
by
aristotle
in

plato
had
actually
already
considered
this
objection
with
idea
of
large
rather
than
man

characters
anachronistically
to
criticize

of

idea
the
dialogue
ends
in

many
recent
philosophers
have
diverged
from
what
some
would
describe
as
ontological
models
and
moral
ideals
characteristic
of
traditional
platonism
a
number
of
these
postmodern
philosophers
have
thus
appeared
to
disparage
platonism
from
more
or
less
informed
perspectives
friedrich
nietzsche
notoriously
attacked
platos
idea
of
good
itself
along
with
many
fundamentals
of
christian
morality
which
he
interpreted
as
platonism
for
masses
in
one
of
his
most
important
works
beyond
good
and
evil
martin
heidegger
argued
against
platos
alleged
obfuscation
of
being
in
his
incomplete
tome
being
and
time
and
philosopher
of
science
karl
popper
argued
in
the
open
society
and
its
enemies
that
platos
alleged
proposal
for
utopian
political
regime
in
republic
was
prototypically
totalitarian
the
dutch
historian
of
science
eduard
jan
dijksterhuis
criticizes
plato
stating
that
he
was
guilty
of
constructing
imaginary
nature
by
reasoning
from
preconceived
principles
and
forcing
reality
more
or
less
to
adapt
itself
to
this
construction
dijksterhuis
adds
that
one
of
errors
into
which
plato
had
fallen
in
almost
grotesque
manner
consisted
in
overestimation
of
what
unaided
thought
ie
without
recourse
to
experience
could
achieve

was
timaeus
until
translations
were
made
after
fall
of
constantinople
which
occurred
during
george
gemistos
plethon
brought
platos
original
writings
from
constantinople
in
century
of
its
fall
it
is
believed
that
plethon
passed
copy
of
dialogues
to
cosimo
de
medici
when
in
council
of
ferrara
called
to
unify
greek
and
latin
churches
was
adjourned
to
florence
where
plethon
then
lectured
on
relation
and
differences
of
plato
and
aristotle
and
fired
cosimo
with
his
enthusiasm
cosimo
would
supply
marsilio
ficino
with
platos
text
for
translation
to
latin
during
early
islamic
era
persian
and
arab
scholars
translated
much
of
plato
into
arabic
and
wrote
commentaries
and
interpretations
on
platos
aristotles
and
other
platonist
philosophers
works
see
alfarabi
avicenna
averroes
hunayn
ibn
ishaq
many
of
these
commentaries
on
plato
were
translated
from
arabic
into
latin
and
as
such
influenced
medieval
scholastic
philosophers
during
renaissance
with
general
resurgence
of
interest
in
classical
civilization
knowledge
of
platos
philosophy
would
become
widespread
again
in
west
many
of
greatest
early
modern
scientists
and
artists
who
broke
with
scholasticism
and
fostered
flowering
of
renaissance
with
support
of
platoinspired
lorenzo
grandson
of
cosimo
saw
platos
philosophy
as
basis
for
progress
in
arts
and
sciences
more
problematic
was
platos
belief
in
metempsychosis
as
well
as
his
ethical
views
on
polyamory
and
euthanasia
in
particular
which
did
not
match
those
of
christianity
it
was
plethons
student
bessarion
who
reconciled
plato
with
christian
theology
arguing
that
platos
views
were
only
ideals
unattainable
due
to
fall
of
man
the
cambridge
platonists
were
around
in
th
century
by
th
century
platos
reputation
was
restored
and
at
least
on
par
with
aristotles
notable
western
philosophers
have
continued
to
draw
upon
platos
work
since
that
time
platos
influence
has
been
especially
strong
in
mathematics
and
sciences
platos
resurgence
further
inspired
some
of
greatest
advances
in
logic
since
aristotle
primarily
through
gottlob
frege
and
his
followers
kurt
gdel
alonzo
church
and
alfred
tarski
albert
einstein
suggested
that
scientist
who
takes
philosophy
seriously
would
have
to
avoid
systematization
and
take
on
many
different
roles
and
possibly
appear
as
platonist
or
pythagorean
in
that
such
one
would
have
viewpoint
of
logical
simplicity
as
indispensable
and
effective
tool
of
his
research
the
safest
general
characterization
of
european
philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes

the

leo
strauss
is
considered
by
some
as
prime
thinker
involved
in
recovery
of
platonic
thought
in
its
more
political
and
less
metaphysical
form
strauss
political
approach
was
in
part
inspired
by
appropriation
of
plato
and
aristotle
by
medieval
jewish
and
islamic
political
philosophers
especially
maimonides
and
alfarabi
as
opposed
to
christian
metaphysical
tradition
that
developed
from
neoplatonism
deeply
influenced
by
nietzsche
and
heidegger
strauss
nonetheless
rejects
their
condemnation
of

platonism
sometimes
distinguished
from
platos
particular
view
by
lowercase
refers
to
view
that
there
are
many
abstract
objects
still
to
this
day
platonists
take
number
and
truths
of
mathematics
as
best
support
in
favour
of
this
view
most
mathematicians
think
like
platonists
that
numbers
and
truths
of
mathematics
are
perceived
by
reason
rather
than
senses
yet
exist
independently
of
minds
and
people
that
is
to
say
they
are
discovered
rather
than
inventedcitation
needed
contemporary
platonism
is
also
more
open
to
idea
of
there
being
infinitely
many
abstract
objects
as
numbers
or
propositions
might
qualify
as
abstract
objects
while
ancient
platonism
seemed
to
resist
this
view
possibly
because
of
need
to
overcome
problem
of
one
and
many
thus
e
g
in
parmenides
dialogue
plato
denies
there
are
forms
for
more
mundane
things
like
hair
and
mud
however
he
repeatedly
does
support
idea
that
there
are
forms
of
artifacts
e
g
form
of
bed
contemporary
platonism
also
tends
to
view
abstract
objects
as
unable
to
cause
anything
but
it
is
unclear
whether
ancient
platonists
felt
this
waycitation

of

as
it
is
often
conceived
rigorous
and
systematic
examination
of
ethical
political
metaphysical
and
epistemological
issues
armed
with
distinctive
methodcan
be
called
his
invention
though
influenced
primarily
by
socrates
to
extent
that
socrates
is
usually
main
character
in
many
of
platos
writings
he
was
also
influenced
by
heraclitus
parmenides
and
pythagoreans
diogenes
lartius
mentions
that
plato
was
born
according
to
some
writers
in
aegina
in
house
of
phidiades
son
of
thales
diogenes
mentions
as
one
of
his
sources
universal
history
of
favorinus
according
to
favorinus
ariston
platos
family
and
his
family
were
sent
by
athens
to
settle
as
cleruchs
colonists
retaining
their
athenian
citizenship
on
island
of
aegina
from
which
spartans
expelled
them
after
platos
birth
there
nails
points
out
however
that
there
is
no
record
of
any
spartan
expulsion
of
athenians
from
aegina
between
bc
on
other
hand
at
peace
of
nicias
aegina
was
silently
left
under
athens
control
and
it
was
not
until
summer
of
that
spartans
overran
island
therefore
nails
concludes
that
perhaps
ariston
was
cleruch
perhaps
he
went
to
aegina
in
and
perhaps
plato
was
born
on
aegina
but
none
of
this
enables
precise
dating
of
aristons
death
or
platos
birth
aegina
is
regarded
as
platos
place
of
birth
by
suda
as
well
apollodorus
of
athens
said
plato
was
born
on
seventh
day
of
month
thargelion
according
to
this
tradition
god
apollo
was
born
this
day
renaissance
platonists
celebrated
platos
birth
on
november
ulrich
von
wilamowitzmoellendorff
estimates
that
plato
was
born
when
diotimos
was
archon
eponymous
namely
between
july
bc
and
july
bc
greek
philologist
ioannis
kalitsounakis
believes
that
he
was
born
on
may
or
bc
according
to
james
adam
some
have
held
that
glaucon
and
adeimantus
were
uncles
of
plato
but
zeller
decides
for
usual
view
that
they
were
brothers
from
aristos
and
kleos
a
scroll
by
philodemus
analysed
in
may
suggest
that
plato
was
enslaved
earlier
than
was
previously
believed
he
regarded
logistic
as
appropriate
for
business
men
and
men
of
war
who
must
learn
art
of
numbers
or
he
will
not
know
how
to
array
his
troops
while
arithmetic
was
appropriate
for
philosophers
because
he
has
to
arise
out
of
sea
of
change
and
lay
hold
of
true
being

unwritten
doctrine
ie
doctrine
rediscovered
by
krmer
and
gaiser
in
one
of
his
letters
epistolae
ficino
writes
the
main
goal
of
divine
plato
is
to
show
one
principle
of
things
which
he
called
one

another

gadamer
is
also
sympathetic
towards
it
cf
grondin
and
gadamer
gadamers
final
position
on
subject
is
stated
in
gadamer
some
use
term
allegory
instead
of
myth
this
is
in
accordance
with
practice
in
specialized
literature
in
which
it
is
common
to
find
that
terms
allegory
and
myth
are
used
as
synonyms
nevertheless
there
is
trend
among
modern
scholars
to
use
term
myth
and
avoid
term
allegory
as
it
is
considered
more
appropriate
to
modern
interpretation
of
platos
writings
one
of
first
to
initiate
this
trend
was
oxford
university
professor
john

founder
of

school
of

and

first
institution
of

learning
in

he
is
widely
considered
pivotal
figure
in

of
ancient
greek
and
western
philosophy
along
with
his
teacher
socrates
and
his
most
famous
student
aristotle
plato
has
also
often
been
cited
as
one
of
founders
of
western
religion
and
spirituality
the
socalled
neoplatonism
of
philosophers
like
plotinus
and
porphyry
greatly
influenced
christianity
through
church
fathers
such
as
augustine
alfred
north
whitehead
once
noted
safest
general
characterization
of
european
philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes
to
plato
plato
was
innovator
of
written
dialogue
and
dialectic
forms
in
philosophy
plato
is
also
considered
founder
of
western
political
philosophy
his
most
famous
contribution
is
theory
of
forms
known
by
pure
reason
in
which
plato
presents
solution
to
problem
of
universals
known
as
platonism
also
ambiguously
called
either
platonic
realism
or
platonic
idealism
he
is
also
namesake
of
platonic
love
and
platonic
solids
his
own
most
decisive
philosophical
influences
are
usually
thought
to
have
been
along
with
socrates
presocratics
pythagoras
heraclitus
and
parmenides
although
few
of
his
predecessors
works
remain

much

early
life
of
plato
birth
and
family
diogenes
laertius
is
principal
source
for
history
of
ancient
greek
philosophy
due
to
lack
of
surviving
accounts
little
is
known
about
platos
early
life
and
education
plato
belonged
to
aristocratic
and
influential
family
according
to
disputed
tradition
reported
by
doxographer
diogenes
lartius
platos
father
ariston
traced
his
descent
from
king
of
athens
codrus
and
king
of
messenia
melanthus
according
to
ancient
hellenic
tradition
codrus
was
said
to
have
been
descended
from
mythological
deity
poseidon
through
his
mother
plato
was
related
to
solon
platos
mother
was
perictione
whose
family
boasted
of
relationship
with
famous
athenian
lawmaker
and
lyric
poet
solon
one
of
seven
sages
who
repealed
laws
of
draco
except
for
death
penalty
for
homicide
perictione
was
sister
of
charmides
and
niece
of
critias
both
prominent
figures
of
thirty
tyrants
known
as
thirty
brief
oligarchic
regime
bc
which
followed
on
collapse
of
athens
at
end
of
peloponnesian
war
bc
according
to
some
accounts
ariston
tried
to
force
his
attentions
on
perictione
but
failed
in
his
purpose
then
god
apollo
appeared
to
him
in
vision
and
as
result
ariston
left
perictione
unmolested
the
exact
time
and
place
of
platos
birth
are
unknown
based
on
ancient
sources
most
modern
scholars
believe
that
he
was
born
in
athens
or
aeginac
between
and
bc
not
long
after
start
of
peloponnesian
ward
the
traditional
date
of
platos
birth
during
th
or
th
olympiad
or
bc
is
based
on
dubious
interpretation
of
diogenes
lartius
who
says
when
socrates
was
gone
plato
joined
cratylus
heracleitean
and
hermogenes
who
philosophized
in
manner
of
parmenides
then
at
twentyeight
hermodorus
says
plato
went
to
euclides
in
megara
however
as
debra
nails
argues
text
does
not
state
that
plato
left
for
megara
immediately
after
joining
cratylus
and
hermogenes
in
his
seventh
letter
plato
notes
that
his
coming
of
age
coincided
with
taking
of
power
by
thirty
remarking
but
youth
under
age
of
twenty
made
himself
laughingstock
if
he
attempted
to
enter
political
arena
thus
nails
dates
platos
birth
to
according
to
neanthes
plato
was
six
years
younger
than
isocrates
and
therefore
was
born
same
year
prominent
athenian
statesman
pericles
died
bc
jonathan
barnes
regards
bc
as
year
of
platos
birth
the
grammarian
apollodorus
of
athens
in
his
chronicles
argues
that
plato
was
born
in
th
olympiad
both
suda
and
sir
thomas
browne
also
claimed
he
was
born
during
th
olympiad
another
legend
related
that
when
plato
was
infant
bees
settled
on
his
lips
while
he
was
sleeping
augury
of
sweetness
of
style
in
which
he
would
discourse
about
philosophy
speusippus
was
platos
nephew
besides
plato
himself
ariston
and
perictione
had
three
other
children
two
sons
adeimantus
and
glaucon
and
daughter
potone
mother
of
speusippus
nephew
and
successor
of
plato
as
head
of
academy
the
brothers
adeimantus
and
glaucon
are
mentioned
in
republic
as
sons
of
ariston
and
presumably
brothers
of
plato
though
some
have
argued
they
were
unclese
in
scenario
in
memorabilia
xenophon
confused
issue
by
presenting
glaucon
much
younger
than
plato
ariston
appears
to
have
died
in
platos
childhood
although
precise
dating
of
his
death
is
difficult
perictione
then
married
pyrilampes
her
mothers
brother
who
had
served
many
times
as
ambassador
to
persian
court
and
was
friend
of
pericles
leader
of
democratic
faction
in
athens
pyrilampes
had
son
from
previous
marriage
demus
who
was
famous
for
his
beauty
perictione
gave
birth
to
pyrilampes
second
son
antiphon
halfbrother
of
plato
who
appears
in
parmenides
in
contrast
to
his
reticence
about
himself
plato
often
introduced
his
distinguished
relatives
into
his
dialogues
or
referred
to
them
with
some
precision
in
addition
to
adeimantus
and
glaucon
in
republic
charmides
has
dialogue
named
after
him
and
critias
speaks
in
both
charmides
and
protagoras
these
and
other
references
suggest
considerable
amount
of
family
pride
and
enable
us
to
reconstruct
platos
family
tree
according
to
burnet
opening
scene
of
charmides
is
glorification
of
whole
family
connection
platos
dialogues
are
not
only
memorial
to
socrates
but
also
happier
days
of
his
own
family
name
the
fact
that
philosopher
in
his
maturity
called
himself
platon
is
indisputable
but
origin
of
this
name
remains
mysterious
platon
is
nickname
from
adjective
plats
broad
although
platon
was
fairly
common
name
instances
are
known
from
athens
alone
name
does
not
occur
in
platos
known
family
line
the
sources
of
diogenes
lartius
account
for
this
by
claiming
that
his
wrestling
coach
ariston
of
argos
dubbed
him
broad
on
account
of
his
chest
and
shoulders
or
that
plato
derived
his
name
from
breadth
of
his
eloquence
or
his
wide
forehead
while
recalling
moral
lesson
about
frugal
living
seneca
mentions
meaning
of
platos
name
his
very
name
was
given
him
because
of
his
broad
chest
plato
was
wrestler
his
true
name
was
supposedly
aristocles
meaning
best
reputationf
according
to
diogenes
lartius
he
was
named
after
his
grandfather
as
was
common
in
athenian
society
but
there
is
only
one
inscription
of
aristocles
early
archon
of
athens
in
bc
there
is
no
record
of
line
from
aristocles
to
platos
father
ariston
recently
scholar
has
argued
that
even
name
aristocles
for
plato
was
much
later
invention
however
another
scholar
claims
that
there
is
good
reason
for
not
dismissing
idea
that
aristocles
was
platos
given
name
as
mere
invention
of
his
biographers
noting
how
prevalent
that
account
is
in
our
sources
education
ancient
sources
describe
him
as
bright
though
modest
boy
who
excelled
in
his
studies
apuleius
informs
us
that
speusippus
praised
platos
quickness
of
mind
and
modesty
as
boy
and
first
fruits
of
his
youth
infused
with
hard
work
and
love
of
study
his
father
contributed
all
which
was
necessary
to
give
to
his
son
good
education
and
therefore
plato
must
have
been
instructed
in
grammar
music
and
gymnastics
by
most
distinguished
teachers
of
his
time
plato
invokes
damon
many
times
in
republic
plato
was
wrestler
and
dicaearchus
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
plato
wrestled
at
isthmian
games
plato
had
also
attended
courses
of
philosophy
before
meeting
socrates
he
first
became
acquainted
with
cratylus
and
heraclitean
doctrines
ambrose
believed
that
plato
met
jeremiah
in
egypt
and
was
influenced
by
his
ideas
augustine
initially
accepted
this
claim
but
later
rejected
it
arguing
in
the
city
of
god
that
plato
was
born
hundred
years
after
jeremiah

plato
may

own
statement
was
that
he
visited
italy
and
sicily
at
age
of
forty
and
was
disgusted
by
sensuality
of
life
there
said
to
have
returned
to

at
age
of
forty
plato
founded
one
of
earliest
known
organized
schools
in
western
civilization
on
plot
of
land
in
grove
of
hecademus
or
academus
this
land
was
named
after
academus
attic
hero
in
greek
mythology
in
historic
greek
times
it
was
adorned
with
oriental
plane
and
olive
plantations
the
academy
was
large
enclosure
of
ground
about
six
stadia
total
of
between
kilometer
and
half
mile
outside
of
athens
proper
one
story
is
that
name
of
academy
comes
from

many

were
schooled
in
academy
most
prominent
one
being
aristotle
throughout
his
later
life
plato
became
entangled
with
politics
of
city
of
syracuse
according
to
diogenes

plato
initially
visited
syracuse
while
it
was
under
rule
of
dionysius
during
this
first
trip
dionysiuss

dion
of
syracuse
became

turned
against

plato
almost
faced

was

subsequently
bought
platos
freedom
for
twenty
minas
and
sent
him
home
after
dionysiuss
death
according
to
platos
seventh
letter
dion
requested
plato
return
to
syracuse
to
tutor
dionysius
ii
and
guide
him
to
become
philosopher
king
dionysius
ii
seemed
to
accept
platos
teachings
but
he
became
suspicious
of
dion
his
uncle
dionysius
expelled
dion
and
kept
plato
against
his
will
eventually
plato
left
syracuse
dion
would
return
to
overthrow
dionysius
and
ruled
syracuse
for
short
time
before
being
usurped
by
calippus
fellow
disciple
of
plato
according
to
seneca
plato
died
at
age
of
on
same
day
he
was
born
the
suda
indicates
that
he
lived
to
years
while
neanthes
claims
age
of
a
variety
of
sources
have
given
accounts
of
his
death
one
story
based
on
mutilated
manuscript
suggests
plato
died
in
his
bed
whilst
young
thracian
girl
played
flute
to
him
another
tradition
suggests
plato
died
at
wedding
feast
the
account
is
based
on
diogenes
lartiuss
reference
to
account
by
hermippus
thirdcentury
alexandrian
according
to
tertullian
plato
simply
died
in

plato
owned

at

which
by

influence
of
pythagoras
upon
plato
or
in
broader
sense
pythagoreans
such
as
archytas
also
appears
to
have
been
significant
aristotle
claimed
that
philosophy
of
plato
closely
followed
teachings
of
pythagoreans
and
cicero
repeats
this
claim
they
say
plato
learned
all
things
pythagorean
it
is
probable
that
both
were
influenced
by
orphism
and
both
believed
in
metempsychosis
transmigration
of
soul
pythagoras
held
that
all
things
are
number
and
cosmos
comes
from
numerical
principles
he
introduced
concept
of
form
as
distinct
from
matter
and
that
physical
world
is
imitation
of
eternal
mathematical
world
these
ideas
were
very
influential
on
heraclitus
parmenides
and
plato
george
karamanolis
notes
that
numenius
accepted
both
pythagoras
and
plato
as
two
authorities
one
should
follow
in
philosophy
but
he
regarded
platos
authority
as
subordinate
to
that
of
pythagoras
whom
he
considered
to
be
source
of
all
true
philosophyincluding
platos
own
for
numenius
it
is
just
that
plato
wrote
so
many
philosophical
works
whereas
pythagoras
views
were
originally
passed
on
only
orally
according
to
r
m
hare
this
influence
consists
of
three
points
the
platonic
republic
might
be
related
to
idea
of
tightly
organized
community
of
likeminded
thinkers
like
one
established
by
pythagoras
in
croton
the
idea
that
mathematics
and
generally
speaking
abstract
thinking
is
secure
basis
for
philosophical
thinking
as
well
as
for
substantial
theses
in
science
and
morals
they
shared
mystical
approach
to
soul
and
its
place
in
material
world
plato
and
mathematics
plato
may
have
studied
under
mathematician
theodorus
of
cyrene
and
has
dialogue
named
for
and
whose
central
character
is
mathematician
theaetetus
while
not
mathematician
plato
was
considered
accomplished
teacher
of
mathematics
eudoxus
of
cnidus
greatest
mathematician
in
classical
greece
who
contributed
much
of
what
is
found
in
euclids
elements
was
taught
by
archytas
and
plato
plato
helped
to
distinguish
between
pure
and
applied
mathematics
by
widening
gap
between
arithmetic

called
number
theory
and
logistic
now
called

assignment
to

associated
each
of
four
classical
elements
earth
air
water
and
fire
with
regular

cube
octahedron
icosahedron
and
tetrahedron
respectively
due
to

the
fifth
regular
solid

was
supposed
to
be

heraclitus
and
parmenides
the
two
philosophers
heraclitus
and
parmenides
following
way
initiated
by
presocratic
greek
philosophers
like
pythagoras
depart
from
mythology
and
begin
metaphysical
tradition
that
strongly
influenced
plato
and
continues
today
heraclitus

hendrick
ter
brugghen
bust
of
parmenides
from

the
surviving
fragments
written
by
heraclitus
suggest
view
that
all
things
are
continuously
changing
or
becoming
his
image
of
river
with
everchanging
waters
is
well
known
according
to
some
ancient
traditions
like
that
of
diogenes
lartius
plato
received
these
ideas
through
heraclitus
disciple
cratylus
who
held
more
radical
view
that
continuous
change
warrants
scepticism
because
we
cannot
define
thing
that
does
not
have
permanent
nature
parmenides
adopted
altogether
contrary
vision
arguing
for
idea
of
changeless
being
and
view
that
change
is
illusion
john
palmer
notes
parmenides
distinction
among
principal
modes
of
being
and
his
derivation
of
attributes
that
must
belong
to
what
must
be
simply
as
such
qualify
him
to
be
seen
as
founder
of
metaphysics
or
ontology
as
domain
of
inquiry
distinct
from
theology
these
ideas
about
change
and
permanence
or
becoming
and
being
influenced
plato
in
formulating
his
theory
of
forms
platos
most
selfcritical
dialogue
is
called
parmenides
featuring
parmenides
and
his
student
zeno
who
following
parmenides
denial
of
change
argued
forcefully
with
his
paradoxes
to
deny
existence
of

platos
sophist
dialogue
includes
eleatic

parmenides
as

arguments
against
parmenides
in

plato
distinguishes
nouns
and
verbs
providing
some
of
earliest
treatment
of
subject
and

he
also
argues
that
motion

of

followers
of

the
precise
relationship
between
plato
and
socrates
remains
area
of
contention
among
scholars
plato
never
speaks
in
his
own
voice
in
his
dialogues
and
speaks
as
socrates
in
all
but
laws
in
second
letter
it
says
no
writing
of
plato
exists
or
ever
will
exist
but
those
now
said
to
be
his
are
those
of
socrates
become
beautiful
and
new
if
letter
is
platos
final
qualification
seems
to
call
into
question
dialogues
historical
fidelity
in
any
case
xenophons
memorabilia
and
aristophaness
the
clouds
seem
to
present
somewhat
different
portrait
of
socrates
from
one
plato
paints
the
socratic
problem
asks
how
to
reconcile
these
various
accounts
leo
strauss
notes
that
socrates
reputation
for
irony
casts
doubt
on
whether
platos
socrates
is
expressing
sincere
beliefs
aristotle
attributes
different
doctrine
with
respect
to
forms
to
plato
and
socrates
aristotle
suggests
that
socrates
idea
of
forms
can
be
discovered
through
investigation
of
natural
world
unlike
platos
forms
that
exist
beyond
and
outside
ordinary
range
of
human
understanding
in
dialogues
of
plato
though
socrates
sometimes
seems
to
support
mystical
side
discussing
reincarnation
and
mystery
religions
this
is
generally
attributed
to
platoclarification
needed
regardless
this
view
of
socrates
cannot
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
as
we
cannot
be
sure
of
differences
between
views
of
plato
and
socrates
in
meno
plato
refers
to
eleusinian
mysteries
telling
meno
he
would
understand
socratess
answers
better
if
he
could
stay
for
initiations
next
week
it
is
possible
that
plato
and
socrates
took
part
in
eleusinian
mysteries
philosophy
metaphysics
in
platos
dialogues
socrates
and
his
company
of
disputants
had
something
to
say
on
many
subjects
including
several
aspects
of
metaphysics
these
include
religion
and
science
human
nature
love
and
sexuality
more
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
perception
and

and

and

and

the

the
windmill
proof
of
pythagorean
theorem
found
in
euclids
elements
platonism
and
its
theory
of
forms
or
theory
of
ideas
denies
reality
of
material
world
considering
it
only
image
or
copy
of
real
world
the
theory
of
forms
is
first
introduced
in
phaedo
dialogue
also
known
as
on
soul
wherein
socrates
refutes
pluralism
of
likes
of
anaxagoras
then
most
popular
response
to
heraclitus
and
parmenides
while
giving
opposites
argument
in
support
of
forms
according
to
this
theory
of
forms
there
are
at
least
two
worlds
apparent
world
of
concrete
objects
grasped
by
senses
which
constantly
changes
and
unchanging
and
unseen
world
of
forms
or
abstract
objects
grasped
by
pure
reason
which
ground
what
is
apparent
it
can
also
be
said
there
are
three
worlds
with
apparent
world
consisting
of
both
world
of
material
objects
and
of
mental
images
with
third
realm
consisting
of
forms
thus
though
there
is
term
platonic
idealism
this
refers
to
platonic
ideas
or
forms
and
not
to
some
platonic
kind
of
idealism
thcentury
view
which
sees
matter
as
unreal
in
favour
of
mind
for
plato
though
grasped
by
mind
only
forms
are
truly
real
platos
forms
thus
represent
types
of
things
as
well
as
properties
patterns
and
relations
to
which
we
refer
as
objects
just
as
individual
tables
chairs
and
cars
refer
to
objects
in
this
world
tableness
chairness
and
carness
as
well
as
e
g
justice
truth
and
beauty
refer
to
objects
in
another
world
one
of
platos
most
cited
examples
for
forms
were
truths
of
geometry
such
as
pythagorean
theorem
in
other
words
forms
are
universals
given
as
solution
to
problem
of
universals
or
problem
of
one
and
many
e
g
how
one
predicate
red
can
apply
to
many
red
objects
for
plato
this
is
because
there
is
one
abstract
object
or
form
of
red
redness
itself
in
which
several
red
things
participate
as
platos
solution
is
that
universals
are
forms
and
that
forms
are
real
if
anything
is
platos
philosophy
is
unambiguously
called
platonic
realism
according
to
aristotle
platos
best
known
argument
in
support
of
forms
was
one
over
many
argument
what
is
justice
aside
from
being
immutable
timeless
changeless
and
one
over
many
forms
also
provide
definitions
and
standard
against
which
all
instances
are
measured
in
dialogues
socrates
regularly
asks
for
meaning
in
sense
of
intensional
definitions
of
general
term
e
g
justice
truth
beauty
and
criticizes
those
who
instead
give
him
particular
extensional
examples
rather
than
quality
shared
by
all
examples
there
is
thus
world
of
perfect
eternal
and
changeless
meanings
of
predicates
forms
existing
in
realm
of
being
outside
of
space
and
time
and
imperfect
sensible
world
of
becoming
subjects
somehow
in
state
between
being
and
nothing
that
partakes
of
qualities
of
forms
and
is
its
instantiation
the
soul
plato
advocates
belief
in
immortality
of
soul
and
several
dialogues
end
with
long
speeches
imagining
afterlife
in
timaeus
socrates
locates
parts
of
soul
within
human
body

in

epistemology
socrates
such
as

also
discuss
several
aspects
of

more
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
knowledge
and
opinion
platos
epistemology
involves
socrates
arguing
that
knowledge
is
not
empirical
and
that
it
comes
from
divine
insight
the
forms
are
also
responsible
for
both
knowledge
or
certainty
and
are
grasped
by
pure
reason
in
several
dialogues
socrates
inverts
common
mans
intuition
about
what
is
knowable
and
what
is
real
reality
is
unavailable
to
those
who
use
their
senses
socrates
says
that
he
who
sees
with
his
eyes
is
blind
while
most
people
take
objects
of
their
senses
to
be
real
if
anything
is
socrates
is
contemptuous
of
people
who
think
that
something
has
to
be
graspable
in
hands
to
be
real
in
theaetetus
he
says
such
people
are
eu
amousoi
expression
that
means
literally
happily
without
muses
in
other
words
such
people
are
willingly
ignorant
living
without
divine
inspiration
and
access
to
higher
insights
about
reality
in
platos
dialogues
socrates
always
insists
on
his
ignorance
and
humility
that
he
knows
nothing
so
called
socratic
irony
several
dialogues
refute
series
of
viewpoints
but
offer
no
positive
position
of
its
own
ending
in
aporia
recollection
in
several
of
platos
dialogues
socrates
promulgates
idea
that
knowledge
is
matter
of
recollection
of
state
before
one
is
born
and
not
of
observation
or
study
keeping
with
theme
of
admitting
his
own
ignorance
socrates
regularly
complains
of
his
forgetfulness
in
meno
socrates
uses
geometrical
example
to
expound
platos
view
that
knowledge
in
this
latter
sense
is
acquired
by
recollection
socrates
elicits
fact
concerning
geometrical
construction
from
slave
boy
who
could
not
have
otherwise
known
fact
due
to
slave
boys
lack
of
education
the

be
present
socrates
concludes
in
eternal
nonexperiential
form
in
other
dialogues
sophist
statesman
republic
and
parmenides
plato
himself
associates
knowledge
with
apprehension
of
unchanging
forms
and
their
relationships
to
one
another
which
he
calls
expertise
in
dialectic
including
through
processes
of
collection
and
division
more
explicitly
plato
himself
argues
in
timaeus
that
knowledge
is
always
proportionate
to
realm
from
which
it
is
gained
in
other
words
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
experientially
because
world
of
sense
is
in
flux
views
therein
attained
will
be
mere
opinions
and
opinions
are
characterized
by
lack
of
necessity
and
stability
on
other
hand
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
by
way
of
nonsensible
forms
because
these
forms
are
unchanging
so
too
is
account
derived
from
them
that
apprehension
of
forms
is
required
for
knowledge
may
be
taken
to
cohere
with
platos
theory
in
theaetetus
and
meno
indeed
apprehension
of
forms
may
be
at
base
of
account
required
for
justification
in
that
it
offers
foundational
knowledge
which
itself
needs
no
account
thereby
avoiding
infinite
regression
justified
true
belief
a
venn
diagram
illustrating
classical
theory
of
knowledge
many
have
interpreted
plato
as
statingeven
having
been
first
to
writethat
knowledge
is
justified
true
belief
influential
view
that
informed
future
developments
in
epistemology
this
interpretation
is
partly
based
on
reading
of
theaetetus
wherein
plato
argues
that
knowledge
is
distinguished
from
mere
true
belief
by
knower
having
account
of
object
of
their
true
belief
and
this
theory
may
again
be
seen
in
meno
where
it
is
suggested
that
true
belief
can
be
raised
to
level
of
knowledge
if
it
is
bound
with
account
as
to
question
of
why
object
of
true
belief
is
so
many
years
later
edmund
gettier
famously
demonstrated
problems
of
justified
true
belief
account
of
knowledge
that
modern
theory
of
justified
true
belief
as
knowledge
which
gettier
addresses
is
equivalent
to
platos
is
accepted
by
some
scholars
but
rejected
by
others
plato
himself
also
identified
problems
with
justified
true
belief
definition
in
theaetetus
concluding
that
justification
or
account
would
require
knowledge
of
difference
meaning
that
definition
of
knowledge
is
circular
ethics
several
dialogues
discuss
ethics
including
virtue
and
vice
pleasure
and
pain
crime
and
punishment
and
justice
and

plato
views
the
good
as
supreme

somehow
existing

socrates
propounded
moral
intellectualism
which
claimed
nobody
does
bad
on
purpose
and
to
know
what
is
good
results
in
doing
what
is
good
that
knowledge
is
virtue
in
protagoras
dialogue
it
is
argued
that
virtue
is
innate
and
cannot
be
learned
socrates
presents
famous
euthyphro
dilemma
in

pious

because
it
is
pious
or
is

a
justice
as
above
in
republic
plato
asks
question
what
is
justice
by
means
of
greek
term
dikaiosune
term
for
justice
that
captures
both
individual
justice
and
justice
that
informs
societies
plato
is
able
not
only
to
inform
metaphysics
but
also
ethics
and
politics
with
question
what
is
basis
of
moral
and
social
obligation
platos
wellknown
answer
rests
upon
fundamental
responsibility
to
seek
wisdom
wisdom
which
leads
to
understanding
of
form
of
good
plato
further
argues
that
such
understanding
of
forms
produces
and
ensures
good
communal
life
when
ideally
structured
under
philosopher
king
in
society
with
three
classes
philosophers
kings
guardians
and
workers
that
neatly
mirror
his
triadic
view
of
individual
soul
reason
spirit
and
appetite
in
this
manner
justice
is
obtained
when
knowledge
of
how
to
fulfill

moral
and

function
in

is
put
into
practice
politics
oxyrhynchus
papyri
with
fragment
of
platos
republic
the
dialogues
also
discuss
politics
some
of
platos
most
famous
doctrines
are
contained
in
republic
as
well
as
in
laws
and
statesman
because
these
doctrines
are
not
spoken
directly
by
plato
and
vary
between
dialogues
they
cannot
be
straightforwardly
assumed
as
representing
platos
own
views
socrates
asserts
that
societies
have
tripartite
class
structure
corresponding
to
appetitespiritreason
structure
of
individual
soul
the
appetitespiritreason
are
analogous
to
castes
of
society
productive
workers
labourers
carpenters
plumbers
masons
merchants
farmers
ranchers
etc
these
correspond
to
appetite
part
of
soul
protective
warriors
or
guardians
those
who
are
adventurous
strong
and
brave
in
armed
forces
these
correspond
to
spirit
part
of
soul
governing
rulers
or
philosopher
kings
those
who
are
intelligent
rational
selfcontrolled
in
love
with
wisdom
well
suited
to
make
decisions
for
community
these
correspond
to
reason
part
of
soul
and
are
very
few
according
to
this
model
principles
of
athenian
democracy
as
it
existed
in
his
day
are
rejected
as
only
few
are
fit
to
rule
instead
of
rhetoric
and
persuasion
socrates
says
reason
and
wisdom
should
govern
as
socrates
puts
it
until
philosophers
rule
as
kings
or
those
who
are
now
called
kings
and
leading
men
genuinely
and
adequately
philosophize
that
is
until
political
power
and
philosophy
entirely
coincide
while
many
natures
who
at
present
pursue
either
one
exclusively
are
forcibly
prevented
from
doing
so
cities
will
have
no
rest
from
evils
nor
i
think
will
human
race
socrates
describes
these
philosopher
kings
as
those
who
love
sight
of
truth
and
supports
idea
with
analogy
of
captain
and
his
ship
or
doctor
and
his
medicine
according
to
him
sailing
and
health
are
not
things
that
everyone
is
qualified
to
practice
by
nature
a
large
part
of
republic
then
addresses
how
educational
system
should
be
set
up
to
produce
these
philosopher
kings
in
addition
ideal
city
is
used
as
image
to
illuminate
state
of
ones
soul
or
will
reason
and
desires
combined
in
human
body
socrates
is
attempting
to
make
image
of
rightly
ordered
human
and
then
later
goes
on
to
describe
different
kinds
of
humans
that
can
be
observed
from
tyrants
to
lovers
of
money
in
various
kinds
of
cities
the
ideal
city
is
not
promoted
but
only
used
to
magnify
different
kinds
of
individual
humans
and
state
of
their
soul
however
philosopher
king
image
was
used
by
many
after
plato
to
justify
their
personal
political
beliefs
the
philosophic
soul
according
to
socrates
has
reason
will
and
desires
united
in
virtuous
harmony
a
philosopher
has
moderate
love
for
wisdom
and
courage
to
act
according
to
wisdom
wisdom
is
knowledge
about
good
or
right
relations
between
all
that
exists
wherein
it
concerns
states
and
rulers
socrates
asks
which
is
better
bad
democracy
or
country
reigned
by
tyrant
he
argues
that
it
is
better
to
be
ruled
by
bad
tyrant
than
by
bad
democracy
since
here
all
people
are
now
responsible
for
such
actions
rather
than
one
individual
committing
many
bad
deeds
this
is
emphasised
within
republic
as
socrates
describes
event
of
mutiny
on
board
ship
socrates
suggests
ships
crew
to
be
in
line
with
democratic
rule
of
many
and
captain
although
inhibited
through
ailments
tyrant
socrates
description
of
this
event
is
parallel
to
that
of
democracy
within
state
and
inherent
problems
that
arise
according
to
socrates
state
made
up
of
different
kinds
of
souls
will
overall
decline
from
aristocracy
rule
by
best
to
timocracy
rule
by
honourable
then
to
oligarchy
rule
by
few
then
to
democracy
rule
by
people
and
finally
to
tyranny
rule
by
one
person
rule
by
tyrant
aristocracy
in
sense
of
government
politeia
is
advocated
in
platos
republic
this
regime
is
ruled
by
philosopher
king
and
thus
is
grounded
on
wisdom
and
reason
the
aristocratic
state
and
man
whose
nature
corresponds
to
it
are
objects
of
platos
analyses
throughout
much
of
republic
as
opposed
to
other
four
types
of
statesmen
who
are
discussed
later
in
his
work
in
book
viii
socrates
states
in
order
other
four
imperfect
societies
with
description
of
states
structure
and
individual
character
in
timocracy
ruling
class
is
made
up
primarily
of
those
with
warriorlike
character
oligarchy
is
made
up
of
society
in
which
wealth
is
criterion
of
merit
and
wealthy
are
in
control
in
democracy
state
bears
resemblance
to
ancient
athens
with
traits
such
as
equality
of
political
opportunity
and
freedom
for
individual
to
do
as
he
likes
democracy
then
degenerates
into
tyranny
from
conflict
of
rich
and
poor
it
is
characterized
by
undisciplined
society
existing
in
chaos
where
tyrant
rises
as
popular
champion
leading
to
formation
of
his
private
army
and
growth
of
oppression
art
and
poetry
several
dialogues
tackle
questions
about
art
including
rhetoric
and
rhapsody
socrates
says
that
poetry
is
inspired
by
muses
and
is
not
rational
he
speaks
approvingly
of
this
and
other
forms
of
divine
madness
drunkenness
eroticism
and
dreaming
in
phaedrus
and
yet
in
republic
wants
to
outlaw
homers
great
poetry
and
laughter
as
well
in
ion
socrates
gives
no
hint
of
disapproval
of
homer
that
he
expresses
in
republic
the
dialogue
ion
suggests
that
homers
iliad
functioned
in
ancient
greek
world
as
bible
does
today
in
modern
christian
world
as
divinely
inspired
literature
that
can
provide
moral
guidance
if
only
it
can
be
properly
interpreted
unwritten
doctrines
bust
excavated
at
villa
of
papyri
possibly
of
dionysus
plato
or
poseidon
for
long
time
platos
unwritten
doctrines
had
been
controversial
many
modern
books
on
plato
seem
to
diminish
its
importance
nevertheless
first
important
witness
who
mentions
its
existence
is
aristotle
who
in
his
physics
writes
it
is
true
indeed
that
account
he
gives
there
ie
in
timaeus
of
participant
is
different
from
what
he
says
in
his
socalled
unwritten
teachings
the
term
literally
means
unwritten
doctrines
or
unwritten
dogmas
and
it
stands
for
most
fundamental
metaphysical
teaching
of
plato
which
he
disclosed
only
orally
and
some
say
only
to
his
most
trusted
fellows
and
which
he
may
have
kept
secret
from
public
the
importance
of
unwritten
doctrines
does
not
seem
to
have
been
seriously
questioned
before
th
century
a
reason
for
not
revealing
it
to
everyone
is
partially
discussed
in
phaedrus
where
plato
criticizes
written
transmission
of
knowledge
as
faulty
favouring
instead
spoken
logos
he
who
has
knowledge
of
just
and
good
and
beautiful
will
not
when
in
earnest
write
them
in
ink
sowing
them
through
pen
with
words
which
cannot
defend
themselves
by
argument
and
cannot
teach
truth
effectually
the
same
argument
is
repeated
in
platos
seventh
letter
every
serious
man
in
dealing
with
really
serious
subjects
carefully
avoids
writing
in
same
letter
he
writes
i
can
certainly
declare
concerning
all
these
writers
who
claim
to
know
subjects
that
i
seriously
study
there
does
not
exist
nor
will
there
ever
exist
any
treatise
of
mine
dealing
therewith
such
secrecy
is
necessary
in
order
not
to
expose
them
to
unseemly
and
degrading
treatment
it
is
however
said
that
plato
once
disclosed
this
knowledge
to
public
in
his
lecture
on
good
in
which
good
is
identified
with
one
unity
fundamental
ontological
principle
the
content
of
this
lecture
has
been
transmitted
by
several
witnesses
aristoxenus
describes
event
in
following
words
each
came
expecting
to
learn
something
about
things
that
are
generally
considered
good
for
men
such
as
wealth
good
health
physical
strength
and
altogether
kind
of
wonderful
happiness
but
when
mathematical
demonstrations
came
including
numbers
geometrical
figures
and
astronomy
and
finally
statement
good
is
one
seemed
to
them
i
imagine
utterly
unexpected
and
strange
hence
some
belittled
matter
while
others
rejected
it
simplicius
quotes
alexander
of
aphrodisias
who
states
that
according
to
plato
first
principles
of
everything
including
forms
themselves
are
one
and
indefinite
duality
which
he
called
large
and
small
and
simplicius
reports
as
well
that
one
might
also
learn
this
from
speusippus
and
xenocrates
and
others
who
were
present
at
platos
lecture
on
good
their
account
is
in
full
agreement
with
aristotles
description
of
platos
metaphysical
doctrine
in
metaphysics
he
writes
now
since
forms
are
causes
of
everything
else
he
ie
plato
supposed
that
their
elements
are
elements
of
all
things
accordingly
material
principle
is
great
and
small
ie
dyad
and
essence
is
one
since
numbers
are
derived
from
great
and
small
by
participation
in
one
from
this
account
it
is
clear
that
he
only
employed
two
causes
that
of
essence
and
material
cause
for
forms
are
cause
of
essence
in
everything
else
and
one
is
cause
of
it
in
forms
he
also
tells
us
what
material
substrate
is
of
which
forms
are
predicated
in
case
of
sensible
things
and
one
in
that
of
formsthat
it
is
this
duality
dyad
great
and
small
further
he
assigned
to
these
two
elements
respectively
causation
of
good
and
of
evil
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
interpretation
of
platos
metaphysics
is
continuity
between
his
teaching
and
neoplatonic
interpretation
of
plotinusi
or
ficinoj
which
has
been
considered
erroneous
by
many
but
may
in
fact
have
been
directly
influenced
by
oral
transmission
of
platos
doctrine
a
modern
scholar
who
recognized
importance
of
unwritten
doctrine
of
plato
was
heinrich
gomperz
who
described
it
in
his
speech
during

international
congress

sources

that

socrates
famously
denies
being
wise
and
explains
how
his
life
as
philosopher
was
launched
by
oracle
at
delphi
he
says
that
his
quest
to
resolve
riddle
of
oracle
put
him
at
odds
with
his
fellow
man
and
that
this
is
reason
he
has
been
mistaken
for
menace
to
citystate
of
athens
in
apology
socrates
is
presented
as
mentioning
plato
by
name
as
one
of
those
youths
close
enough
to
him
to
have
been
corrupted
if
he
were
in

guilty
of
corrupting

and
questioning
why
their
fathers
and
brothers
did
not
step
forward
to
testify
against
him
if
he
was
indeed
guilty
of
such
crime

in

the

largest
gathering
of

associates
in

plato
is
most
celebrated
and
admired
for
socrates
is
concerned
with
human
and
political
virtue
has
distinctive
personality
and
friends
and
enemies
who
travel
with
him
from
dialogue
to
dialogue
this
is
not
to
say
that
socrates
is
consistent
man
who
is
his
friend
in
one
dialogue
may
be
adversary
or
subject
of
his
mockery
in
another
for
example
socrates
praises
wisdom
of
euthyphro
many
times
in
cratylus
but
makes
him
look
like
fool
in
euthyphro
he
disparages
sophists
generally
and
prodicus
specifically
in
apology
whom
he
also
slyly
jabs
in
cratylus
for
charging
hefty
fee
of
fifty
drachmas
for
course
on
language
and
grammar
however
socrates
tells
theaetetus
in
his
namesake
dialogue
that
he
admires
prodicus
and
has
directed
many
pupils
to
him
socrates
ideas
are
also
not
consistent

between

among
dialogues
allegories
main
article
allegorical
interpretations
of
plato
mythos
and
logos
are
terms
that
evolved
along
classical
greek
history
in
times
of
homer
and
hesiod
th
century
bc
they
were
essentially
synonyms
and
contained
meaning
of
tale
or
history
later
came
historians
like
herodotus
and
thucydides
as
well
as
philosophers
like
heraclitus
and
parmenides
and
other
presocratics
who
introduced
distinction
between
both
terms
mythos
became
more
nonverifiable
account
and
logos
rational
account
it
may
seem
that
plato
being
disciple
of
socrates
and
strong
partisan
of
philosophy
based
on
logos
should
have
avoided
use
of
mythtelling
instead
he
made
abundant
use
of
it
this
fact
has
produced
analytical
and
interpretative
work
in
order
to
clarify
reasons
and
purposes
for
that
use
plato
in
general
distinguished
between
three
types
of
mythl
first
there
were
false
myths
like
those
based
on
stories
of
gods
subject
to
passions
and
sufferings
because
reason
teaches
that
god
is
perfect
then
came
myths
based
on
true
reasoning
and
therefore
also
true
finally
there
were
those
non
verifiable
because
beyond
of
human
reason
but
containing
some
truth
in
them
regarding
subjects
of
platos
myths
they
are
of
two
types
those
dealing
with
origin
of
universe
and
those
about
morals
and
origin
and
fate
of
soul
it
is
generally
agreed
that
main
purpose
for
plato
in
using
myths
was
didactic
he
considered
that
only
few
people
were
capable
or
interested
in
following
reasoned
philosophical
discourse
but
men
in
general
are
attracted
by
stories
and
tales
consequently
then
he
used
myth
to
convey
conclusions
of
philosophical
reasoning
some
of
platos
myths
were
based
in
traditional
ones
others
were
modifications
of
them
and
finally
he
also
invented
altogether
new
myths
notable
examples
include
story
of
atlantis
myth
of
er
and
allegory
of
cave
the
cave
platos
allegory
of
cave
by
jan
saenredam
according
to
cornelis
van
haarlem
albertina
vienna
the
theory
of
forms
is
most
famously
captured
in
his
allegory
of
cave
and
more
explicitly
in
his
analogy
of
sun
and
divided
line
the
allegory
of
cave
is
paradoxical
analogy
wherein
socrates
argues
that
invisible
world
is
most
intelligible
noeton
and
that
visible
world
horaton
is
least
knowable
and
most
obscure
socrates
says
in
republic
that
people
who
take
sunlit
world
of
senses
to
be
good
and
real
are
living
pitifully
in
den
of
evil
and
ignorance
socrates
admits
that
few
climb
out
of
den
or
cave
of
ignorance
and
those
who
do
not
only
have
terrible
struggle
to
attain
heights
but
when
they
go
back
down
for
visit
or
to
help
other
people
up
they
find
themselves
objects
of
scorn
and
ridicule
according
to
socrates
physical
objects
and
physical
events
are
shadows
of
their
ideal
or
perfect
forms
and
exist
only
to
extent
that
they
instantiate
perfect
versions
of
themselves
just
as
shadows
are
temporary
inconsequential
epiphenomena
produced
by
physical
objects
physical
objects
are
themselves
fleeting
phenomena
caused
by
more
substantial
causes
ideals
of
which
they
are
mere
instances
for
example
socrates
thinks
that
perfect
justice
exists
although
it
is
not
clear
where
and
his
own
trial
would
be
cheap
copy
of
it
the
allegory
of
cave
is
intimately
connected
to
his
political
ideology
that
only
people
who
have
climbed
out
of
cave
and
cast
their
eyes
on
vision
of
goodness
are
fit
to
rule
socrates
claims
that
enlightened
men
of
society
must
be
forced
from
their
divine
contemplation
and
be
compelled
to
run
city
according
to
their
lofty
insights
thus
is
born
idea
of
philosopherking
wise
person
who
accepts
power
thrust
upon
him
by
people
who
are
wise
enough
to
choose
good
master
this
is
main
thesis
of
socrates
in
republic
that
most
wisdom
masses
can
muster
is
wise
choice
of
ruler
ring
of
gyges
a
ring
which
could
make
one
invisible
ring
of
gyges
is
proposed
in
republic
by
character
of
glaucon
and
considered
by
rest
of
characters
for
its
ethical
consequences
whether
individual
possessing
it
would
be
most
happy
abstaining
or
doing
injustice
chariot
he
also
compares
soul
psyche
to
chariot
in
this
allegory
he
introduces
triple
soul
which
composed
of
charioteer
and
two
horses
the
charioteer
is
symbol
of
intellectual
and
logical
part
of
soul
logistikon
and
two
horses
represents
moral
virtues
thymoeides
and
passionate
instincts
epithymetikon
respectively
to
illustrate
conflict
between
them
dialectic
socrates
employs
dialectic
method
which
proceeds
by
questioning
the
role
of
dialectic
in
platos
thought
is
contested
but
there
are
two
main
interpretations
type
of
reasoning
and
method
of
intuition
simon
blackburn
adopts
first
saying
that
platos
dialectic
is
process
of
eliciting
truth
by
means
of
questions
aimed
at
opening
out
what
is
already
implicitly
known
or
at
exposing
contradictions
and
muddles
of
opponents
position
a
similar
interpretation
has
been
put
forth
by
louis
hartz
who
suggests
that
elements
of
dialectic
are
borrowed
from
hegel
according
to
this
view
opposing
arguments
improve
upon
each
other
and
prevailing
opinion
is
shaped
by
synthesis
of
many
conflicting
ideas
over
time
each
new
idea
exposes
flaw
in
accepted
model
and
epistemological
substance
of
debate
continually
approaches
truth
hartzs
is
teleological
interpretation
at
core
in
which
philosophers
will
ultimately
exhaust
available
body
of
knowledge
and
thus
reach
end
of
history
karl
popper
on
other
hand
claims
that
dialectic
is
art
of
intuition
for
visualising
divine
originals
forms
or
ideas
of
unveiling
great
mystery
behind
common
mans
everyday
world
of
appearances
family
plato
often
discusses
fatherson
relationship
and
question
of
whether
fathers
interest
in
his
sons
has
much
to
do
with
how
well
his
sons
turn
out
in
ancient
athens
boy
was
socially
located
by
his
family
identity
and
plato
often
refers
to
his
characters
in
terms
of
their
paternal
and
fraternal
relationships
socrates
was
not
family
man
and
saw
himself
as
son
of
his
mother
who
was
apparently
midwife
a
divine
fatalist
socrates
mocks
men
who
spent
exorbitant
fees
on
tutors
and
trainers
for
their
sons
and
repeatedly
ventures
idea
that
good
character
is
gift
from
gods
platos
dialogue
crito
reminds
socrates
that
orphans
are
at
mercy
of
chance
but
socrates
is
unconcerned
in
theaetetus
he
is
found
recruiting
as
disciple
young
man
whose
inheritance
has
been
squandered
socrates
twice
compares
relationship
of
older
man
and
his
boy
lover
to
fatherson
relationship
and
in
phaedo
socrates
disciples
towards
whom
he
displays
more
concern
than
his
biological
sons
say
they
will
feel
fatherless
when
he
is
gone
though
plato
agreed
with
aristotle
that
women
were
inferior
to
men
in
fourth
book
of
republic
character
of
socrates
says
this
was
only
because
of
nomos
or
custom
and
not
because
of
nature
and
thus
women
needed
paidia
rearing
or
education
to
be
equal
to
men
in
merely
probable
tale
of
eponymous
character
in
timaeus

plato
never
presents
himself
as
participant
in
any
of
dialogues
and
with
exception
of
apology
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
heard
any
of

some

no

indication
that

wearied

with

thirtyfive
dialogues
and
thirteen
letters

have
traditionally
been
ascribed
to
plato
though
modern
scholarship
doubts
authenticity
of
at
least
some
of
these
platos
writings
have
been
published
in
several
fashions
this
has
led
to
several
conventions
regarding
naming
and
referencing
of
platos
texts
the
usual
system
for
making
unique
references
to
sections
of
text
by
plato
derives
from
thcentury
edition
of
platos
works
by
henricus
stephanus
known
as
stephanus
pagination
one
tradition
regarding
arrangement
of
platos
texts
is
according
to
tetralogies
this
scheme
is
ascribed
by
diogenes
lartius
to
ancient
scholar
and
court
astrologer
to
tiberius
named
thrasyllus

platos
dialogues
were
written
in
nor
extent
to
which
some
might
have
been
later
revised
and
rewritten
the
works
are
usually
grouped
into
early
sometimes
by
some
into
transitional
middle
and
late
period
this
choice
to
group
chronologically
is
thought
worthy
of
criticism
by
some
cooper
et
al
given
that
it
is
recognized
that
there
is
no
absolute
agreement
as
to
true
chronology
since
facts
of
temporal
order
of
writing
are
not
confidently
ascertained
chronology
was
not
consideration
in
ancient
times
in
that
groupings
of
this
nature
are
virtually
absent
tarrant
in
extant
writings
of
ancient
platonists
whereas
those
classified
as
early
dialogues
often
conclude
in
aporia
socalled
middle
dialogues
provide
more
clearly
stated
positive
teachings
that
are
often
ascribed
to
plato
such
as
theory
of
forms
the
remaining
dialogues
are
classified
as
late
and
are
generally
agreed
to
be
difficult
and
challenging
pieces
of
philosophy
this
grouping
is
only
one
proven
by
stylometric
analysis
among
those
who
classify
dialogues
into
periods
of
composition
socrates
figures
in
all
of
early
dialogues
and
they
are
considered
most
faithful
representations
of
historical
socrates
the
following
represents
one
relatively
common
division
it
should
however
be
kept
in
mind
that
many
of
positions
in
ordering
are
still
highly
disputed
and
also
that
very
notion
that
platos
dialogues
can
or
should
be
ordered
is
by
no
means
universally
accepted
increasingly
in
most
recent
plato
scholarship
writers
are
sceptical
of
notion
that
order
of
platos
writings
can
be
established
with
any
precision
though
platos
works
are
still
often
characterized
as
falling
at
least
roughly
into
three
groups
early
apology
charmides
crito
euthyphro
gorgias
lesser
hippias
minor

hippias

politicus

a
significant
distinction
of
early
plato
and
later
plato
has
been
offered
by
scholars
such
as
er
dodds
and
has
been
summarized
by
harold
bloom
in
his
book
titled
agon
er
dodds
is
classical
scholar
whose
writings
most
illuminated
hellenic
descent
in
the
greeks
and
irrational
in
his
chapter
on
plato
and
irrational
soul
dodds
traces
platos
spiritual
evolution
from
pure
rationalist
of
protagoras
to
transcendental
psychologist
influenced
by
pythagoreans
and
orphics
of
later
works
culminating
in
laws
lewis
campbell
was
first
to
make
exhaustive
use
of
stylometry
to
prove
great
probability
that
critias
timaeus
laws
philebus
sophist
and
statesman
were
all
clustered
together
as
group
while
parmenides
phaedrus
republic
and
theaetetus
belong
to
separate
group
which
must
be
earlier
given
aristotles
statement
in
his
politics
that
laws
was
written
after
republic
cf
diogenes
lartius
lives
what
is
remarkable
about
campbells
conclusions
is
that
in
spite
of
all
stylometric
studies
that
have
been
conducted
since
his
time
perhaps
only
chronological
fact
about
platos
works
that
can
now
be
said
to
be
proven
by
stylometry
is
fact
that
critias
timaeus
laws
philebus
sophist
and
statesman
are
latest
of
platos
dialogues
others
earlier
protagoras
is
often
considered
one
of
last
of
early
dialogues
three
dialogues
are
often
considered
transitional
or
premiddle
euthydemus
gorgias
and
meno
proponents
of
dividing
dialogues
into
periods
often
consider
parmenides
and
theaetetus
to
come
late
in
middle
period
and
be
transitional
to
next
as
they
seem
to
treat
theory
of
forms
critically
parmenides
or
only
indirectly
theaetetus
ritters
stylometric
analysis
places
phaedrus
as
probably
after
theaetetus
and
parmenides
although
it
does
not
relate
to
theory
of
forms
in
same
way
the
first
book
of
republic
is
often
thought
to
have
been
written
significantly
earlier
than
rest
of
work
although
possibly
having
undergone
revisions
when
later
books
were
attached
to
it
while
looked
to
for
platos
mature
answers
to
questions
posed
by
his
earlier
works
those
answers
are
difficult
to
discern
some
scholars
indicate
that
theory
of
forms
is
absent
from
late
dialogues
its
having
been
refuted
in
parmenides
but
there
isnt
total
consensus
that
parmenides
actually
refutes
theory
of
forms
writings
of
doubted
authenticity

that

to
that

even
when
actual
author
was
unknown

there
is
no

series

philosophical
texts
including
few
of
platos
criticism
the
most
famous
criticism
of
theory
of
forms
is
third
man
argument
by
aristotle
in
metaphysics
plato
had
actually
already
considered
this
objection
with
idea
of
large
rather
than
man
in
dialogue
parmenides
using
elderly
elean
philosophers
parmenides
and
zeno
characters
anachronistically
to
criticize
character
of
younger
socrates
who
proposed
idea
the
dialogue
ends
in
aporia
many
recent
philosophers
have
diverged
from
what
some
would
describe
as
ontological
models
and
moral
ideals
characteristic
of
traditional
platonism
a
number
of
these
postmodern
philosophers
have
thus
appeared
to
disparage
platonism
from
more
or
less
informed
perspectives
friedrich
nietzsche
notoriously
attacked
platos
idea
of
good
itself
along
with
many
fundamentals
of
christian
morality
which
he
interpreted
as
platonism
for
masses
in
one
of
his
most
important
works
beyond
good
and
evil
martin
heidegger
argued
against
platos
alleged
obfuscation
of
being
in
his
incomplete
tome
being
and
time
and
philosopher
of
science
karl
popper
argued
in
the
open
society
and
its
enemies
that
platos
alleged
proposal
for
utopian
political
regime
in
republic
was
prototypically
totalitarian
the
dutch
historian
of
science
eduard
jan
dijksterhuis
criticizes
plato
stating
that
he
was
guilty
of
constructing
imaginary
nature
by
reasoning
from
preconceived
principles
and
forcing
reality
more
or
less
to
adapt
itself
to
this
construction
dijksterhuis
adds
that
one
of
errors
into
which
plato
had
fallen
in
almost
grotesque
manner
consisted
in
overestimation
of
what
unaided
thought
ie
without
recourse
to
experience
could
achieve
in

of
natural

platos
thought
is
often
compared
with
that
of
his
most
famous
student
aristotle
whose
reputation
during
western
middle
ages
so
completely
eclipsed
that
of
plato
that
scholastic
philosophers
referred
to
aristotle
as
philosopher
however
in
byzantine
empire
study
of
plato
continued
the
only
platonic
work
known
to
western
scholarship
was
timaeus
until
translations
were
made
after
fall
of
constantinople
which
occurred
during
george
gemistos
plethon
brought
platos
original
writings
from
constantinople
in
century
of
its
fall
it
is
believed
that
plethon
passed
copy
of
dialogues
to
cosimo
de
medici
when
in
council
of
ferrara
called
to
unify
greek
and
latin
churches
was
adjourned
to
florence
where
plethon
then
lectured
on
relation
and
differences
of
plato
and
aristotle
and
fired
cosimo
with
his
enthusiasm
cosimo
would
supply
marsilio
ficino
with
platos
text
for
translation
to
latin
during
early
islamic
era
persian
and
arab
scholars
translated
much
of
plato
into
arabic
and
wrote
commentaries
and
interpretations
on
platos
aristotles
and
other
platonist
philosophers
works
see
alfarabi
avicenna
averroes
hunayn
ibn
ishaq
many
of
these
commentaries
on
plato
were
translated
from
arabic
into
latin
and
as
such
influenced
medieval
scholastic
philosophers
during
renaissance
with
general
resurgence
of
interest
in
classical
civilization
knowledge
of
platos
philosophy
would
become
widespread
again
in
west
many
of
greatest
early
modern
scientists
and
artists
who
broke
with
scholasticism
and
fostered
flowering
of
renaissance
with
support
of
platoinspired
lorenzo
grandson
of
cosimo
saw
platos
philosophy
as
basis
for
progress
in
arts
and
sciences
more
problematic
was
platos
belief
in
metempsychosis
as
well
as
his
ethical
views
on
polyamory
and
euthanasia
in
particular
which
did
not
match
those
of
christianity
it
was
plethons
student
bessarion
who
reconciled
plato
with
christian
theology
arguing
that
platos
views
were
only
ideals
unattainable
due
to
fall
of
man
the
cambridge
platonists
were
around
in
th
century
by
th
century
platos
reputation
was
restored
and
at
least
on
par
with
aristotles
notable
western
philosophers
have
continued
to
draw
upon
platos
work
since
that
time
platos
influence
has
been
especially
strong
in
mathematics
and
sciences
platos
resurgence
further
inspired
some
of
greatest
advances
in
logic
since
aristotle
primarily
through
gottlob
frege
and
his
followers
kurt
gdel
alonzo
church
and
alfred
tarski
albert
einstein
suggested
that
scientist
who
takes
philosophy
seriously
would
have
to
avoid
systematization
and
take
on
many
different
roles
and
possibly
appear
as
platonist
or
pythagorean
in
that
such
one
would
have
viewpoint
of
logical
simplicity
as
indispensable
and
effective
tool
of
his
research
the
safest
general
characterization
of
european
philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes
to
plato
alfred

process
and
reality
the
political
philosopher
and
professor
leo
strauss
is
considered
by
some
as
prime
thinker
involved
in
recovery
of
platonic
thought
in
its
more
political
and
less
metaphysical
form
strauss
political
approach
was
in
part
inspired
by
appropriation
of
plato
and
aristotle
by
medieval
jewish
and
islamic
political
philosophers
especially
maimonides
and
alfarabi
as
opposed
to
christian
metaphysical
tradition
that
developed
from
neoplatonism
deeply
influenced
by
nietzsche
and
heidegger
strauss
nonetheless
rejects
their
condemnation
of
plato
and
looks
to

platonism
sometimes
distinguished
from
platos
particular
view
by
lowercase
refers
to
view
that
there
are
many
abstract
objects
still
to
this
day
platonists
take
number
and
truths
of
mathematics
as
best
support
in
favour
of
this
view
most
mathematicians
think
like
platonists
that
numbers
and
truths
of
mathematics
are
perceived
by
reason
rather
than
senses
yet
exist
independently
of
minds
and
people
that
is
to
say
they
are
discovered
rather
than
inventedcitation
needed
contemporary
platonism
is
also
more
open
to
idea
of
there
being
infinitely
many
abstract
objects
as
numbers
or
propositions
might
qualify
as
abstract
objects
while
ancient
platonism
seemed
to
resist
this
view
possibly
because
of
need
to
overcome
problem
of
one
and
many
thus
e
g
in
parmenides
dialogue
plato
denies
there
are
forms
for
more
mundane
things
like
hair
and
mud
however
he
repeatedly
does
support
idea
that
there
are
forms
of
artifacts
e
g
form
of
bed
contemporary
platonism
also
tends
to
view
abstract
objects
as
unable
to
cause
anything
but
it
is
unclear
whether
ancient
platonists
felt
this
waycitation

was
silently
left
under

control
and
it
was
not
until

of
that

overran

therefore
nails
concludes
that
perhaps
ariston
was
cleruch
perhaps
he
went
to
aegina
in
and
perhaps
plato
was
born
on

none

of
such
approach
is
given
by
szlezak
another
supporter
of
this
interpretation
is
german
philosopher
karl
albert
cf
albert
or
albert
hansgeorg
gadamer
is
also
sympathetic
towards
it
cf
grondin
and
gadamer
gadamers
final
position
on
subject
is
stated
in
gadamer
some
use
term
allegory
instead
of
myth
this
is
in
accordance
with
practice
in
specialized
literature
in
which
it
is
common
to
find
that
terms
allegory
and
myth
are
used
as
synonyms
nevertheless
there
is
trend
among
modern
scholars
to
use
term
myth
and
avoid
term
allegory
as
it
is
considered
more
appropriate
to
modern
interpretation
of
platos
writings
one
of
first
to
initiate
this
trend
was
oxford
university
professor
john
alexander
stewart
in
his
work
the
myths
of
plato
the
time
is
not
long
after
death
of
socrates

aristotle
provided
complex
synthesis
of
various
philosophies
existing
prior
to
him
it
was
above
all
from
his
teachings
that
west
inherited
its
intellectual
lexicon
as
well
as
problems
and
methods
of
inquiry
as
result
his
philosophy
has
exerted
unique
influence
on
almost
every
form
of
knowledge
in
west
and
it
continues
to
be
subject
of
contemporary
philosophical
discussion
little
is
known
about
his
life
aristotle
was
born
in
city
of
stagira
in
northern
greece
his
father
nicomachus
died
when
aristotle
was
child

he
was
brought
up
by

at
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
he
joined
platos
academy
in

and
remained
there
until

c
bc
shortly
after

died
aristotle
left
athens
and
at
request
of
philip
ii
of
macedon
tutored
alexander
great
beginning
in
bc
he
established
library
in
lyceum
which
helped
him
to
produce
many
of
his
hundreds
of
books
on
papyrus
scrolls
though
aristotle
wrote
many
elegant
treatises
and
dialogues
for
publication
only
around
third
of
his
original
output

aristotles
views
on
physical
science
profoundly
shaped
medieval
scholarship
their
influence
extended
from
late
antiquity
and
early
middle
ages
into
renaissance
and
were
not
replaced
systematically
until
enlightenment
and
theories
such
as
classical
mechanics
were
developed
some
of
aristotles
zoological
observations
found
in
his
biology
such
as
on
hectocotyl
reproductive
arm
of
octopus
were
disbelieved
until
th
century
his
works
contain

known
formal
study
of

studied
by
medieval
scholars
such
as
peter
abelard
and
john
buridan
aristotles
influence
on
logic
also
continued
well
into
th
century
he
influenced
judeoislamic
philosophies
during
middle
ages
as
well
as
christian
theology
especially
neoplatonism
of
early
church
and
scholastic
tradition
of
catholic
church
aristotle
was
revered
among
medieval
muslim
scholars
as

pointsb
aristotle
whose
name
means
best
purpose
in
ancient
greek
was
born
in
bc
in
stagira
chalcidice
about
km
miles
east
of
modernday
thessaloniki
his
father
nicomachus
was
personal
physician
to
king
amyntas
of
macedon
while
he
was
young
aristotle
learned
about
biology
and
medical
information
which
was
taught
by
his
father
both
of
aristotles
parents
died
when
he
was
about
thirteen
and
proxenus
of
atarneus
became
his
guardian
although
little
information
about
aristotles
childhood
has
survived
he
probably
spent
some
time
within
macedonian
palace
making
his
first
connections
with
macedonian
monarchy
at
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
aristotle
moved
to
athens
to
continue
his
education
at
platos
academy
he
probably
experienced
eleusinian
mysteries
as
he
wrote
when
describing
sights

at
eleusinian
mysteries

aristotle
remained
in
athens
for
nearly
twenty
years
before
leaving
in
bc
the
traditional
story
about
his
departure
records
that
he
was
disappointed
with
academys
direction
after
control
passed
to
platos
nephew
speusippus
although
it
is
possible
that
he
feared
antimacedonian
sentiments
in
athens
at
that
time
and
left
before
plato
died
aristotle
then
accompanied
xenocrates
to
court
of
his
friend
hermias
of
atarneus
in
asia
minor
after
death
of
hermias
aristotle
travelled
with
his
pupil
theophrastus
to
island
of
lesbos
where
together
they
researched
botany
and
zoology
of
island
and
its
sheltered
lagoon
while
in
lesbos
aristotle
married
pythias

he
gave

alexander
but
also
to
two
other
future
kings
ptolemy
and
cassander
aristotle
encouraged
alexander
toward
eastern
conquest
and
aristotles
own
attitude
towards
persia
was
unabashedly
ethnocentric
in
one
famous
example
he
counsels
alexander
to
be
leader
to
greeks
and
despot
to
barbarians
to
look
after
former
as
after
friends
and
relatives
and
to
deal
with

as

returned
to
athens

his
own
school
there
known
as

twelve
years

is
believed
to
have
composed
many
of
his
works
he
wrote
many
dialogues
of
which
only
fragments

those
works
that

aristotle
the
word
metaphysics
appears
to
have
been
coined
by
first
century
ad
editor
who
assembled
various
small
selections
of
aristotles
works
to
treatise
we
know
by
name
metaphysics
aristotle
called
it
first
philosophy
and
distinguished
it
from
mathematics
and
natural
science
physics
as
contemplative
theoretik
philosophy
which
is
theological
and
studies
divine
he
wrote
in
his
metaphysics
a
if
there
were
no
other
independent
things
besides
composite
natural
ones
study
of
nature
would
be
primary
kind
of
knowledge
but
if
there
is
some
motionless
independent
thing
knowledge
of
this
precedes
it
and
is
first
philosophy
and
it
is
universal
in
just
this
way
because
it
is
first
and
it
belongs
to
this
sort
of
philosophy
to
study
being
as
being
both
what
it
is
and
what
belongs
to
it

by

what

was
to
be

and
he
concludes
that
particular
substance
is
combination
of
both
matter
and

philosophical
theory
called
hylomorphism
in
book
viii
he
distinguishes
matter
of
substance
as
substratum
or
stuff
of
which
it
is
composed
for
example
matter
of
house
is
bricks

exist
as

for
aristotle
both
matter
and
form
belong
to
individual
thing
hylomorphism
like
his
teacher
plato
aristotles
philosophy
aims
at
universal
aristotles
ontology
places
universal
katholou
in
particulars
kath
hekaston
things
in

whereas
for
plato
universal
is
separately
existing
form
which
actual
things
imitate
for
aristotle
form
is
still
what
phenomena
are
based
on
but
is
instantiated
in
particular
substance
plato
argued
that
all
things
have
universal
form
which
could
be
either
property
or
relation
to
other
things
when
one
looks
at
apple
for
example
one
sees
apple
and
one
can
also
analyse
form
of
apple
in
this
distinction
there
is
particular
apple
and
universal
form
of
apple
moreover
one
can
place
apple
next
to
book
so
that
one
can
speak
of
both
book
and
apple
as
being
next
to
each
other
plato
argued
that
there
are
some
universal
forms
that
are
not
part
of
particular
things
for
example
it
is
possible
that
there
is
no
particular
good
in
existence
but
good
is
still
proper
universal
form
aristotle
disagreed
with
plato
on
this
point
arguing
that
all
universals
are
instantiated
at
some
period
of
time
and
that
there
are
no
universals
that
are
unattached
to
existing
things
in
addition
aristotle
disagreed
with
plato
about
location
of
universals
where
plato
spoke
of
world
of
forms
place
where
all
universal
forms
subsist
aristotle
maintained
that
universals
exist
within
each
thing
on
which
each
universal
is
predicated
so
according
to
aristotle
form
of
apple
exists
within
each
apple

than
in

potentiality
and

aristotle
with
regard
to
change
kinesis
and
its
causes
now
as
he
defines
in
his
physics
and
on
generation
and
corruption
ba
he
distinguishes
coming
to
be
from
growth
and
diminution
which
is
change
in
quantity
locomotion
which
is
change
in
space
and
alteration
which
is
change
in
quality
aristotle
argued
that
capability
like
playing
flute
could
be
acquired
potential
made
actual
by
learning
the
coming
to
be
is
change
where
nothing
persists
of
which
resultant
is
property
in
that
particular
change
he
introduces
concept
of
potentiality
dynamis
and
actuality
entelecheia
in
association
with
matter
and
form
referring
to
potentiality
this
is
what
thing
is
capable
of
doing
or
being
acted
upon
if
conditions
are
right
and
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
else
for
example
seed
of
plant
in
soil
is
potentially
dynamei
plant
and
if
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
it
will
become
plant
potentially
beings
can
either
act
poiein
or
be
acted
upon
paschein
which
can
be
either
innate
or
learned
for
example
eyes
possess
potentiality
of
sight
innate
being
acted
upon
while
capability
of
playing
flute
can
be
possessed
by
learning
exercise
acting
actuality
is
fulfilment
of
end
of
potentiality
because
end
telos
is
principle
of
every
change
and
for
sake
of
end
exists
potentiality
therefore
actuality
is
end
referring
then
to
previous
example
it
can
be
said
that
actuality
is
when
plant
does
one
of
activities
that
plants
do
for
that
for
sake
of
which
to
hou
heneka
thing
is
is
its
principle
and
becoming
is
for
sake
of
end
and
actuality
is
end
and
it
is
for
sake
of
this
that
potentiality
is
acquired
for
animals
do
not
see
in
order
that
they
may
have
sight
but
they
have
sight
that
they
may
see
in
summary
matter
used
to
make
house
has
potentiality
to
be
house
and
both
activity
of
building
and
form
of
final
house
are
actualities
which
is
also
final
cause
or
end
then
aristotle
proceeds
and
concludes
that
actuality
is
prior
to
potentiality
in
formula
in
time
and
in
substantiality
with
this
definition
of
particular
substance
ie
matter
and
form
aristotle
tries
to
solve
problem
of
unity
of
beings
for
example
what
is
it
that
makes
man
one
since
according
to
plato
there
are
two
ideas
animal
and
biped
how
then
is
man
unity
however
according
to
aristotle
potential
being
matter
and
actual
one
form
are
one
and
same
epistemology
aristotles
immanent
realism
means
his
epistemology
is
based
on
study
of
things
that
exist
or
happen
in
world
and
rises
to
knowledge
of
universal
whereas
for
plato
epistemology
begins
with
knowledge
of
universal
forms
or
ideas
and
descends
to
knowledge
of
particular
imitations
of
these
aristotle
uses
induction
from
examples
alongside
deduction

plato
relies
on
deduction
from

its
design

techniques
used
efficient
cause
and
its
decorative
or
practical

final
cause
aristotle
suggested
that
reason
for
anything
coming
about
can
be
attributed
to
four
different
types
of
simultaneously
active
factors
his
term
aitia
is
traditionally
translated
as
cause
but
it
does
not
always
refer
to
temporal
sequence
it
might
be
better
translated
as
explanation
but
traditional
rendering
will
be
employed
here
material
cause
describes
material
out
of
which
something
is
composed
thus
material
cause
of
table
is
wood
it
is
not
about
action
it
does
not
mean
that
one
domino
knocks
over
another

the
formal
cause

its

plainly

a

example
of
formal
cause
is
mental
image
or
idea
that
allows
artist
architect
or
engineer
to
create
drawing
the
efficient
cause
is
primary
source
or
that
from
which
change
under
consideration
proceeds
it
identifies
what
makes
of
what
is
made
and
what
causes
change
of
what
is
changed
and
so
suggests
all
sorts
of
agents
nonliving
or
living
acting
as
sources
of
change
or
movement
or
rest
representing
current
understanding
of
causality
as

this

modern

of

as
either
agent
or
agency
or
particular
events

in

of
two
dominoes
when
first
is
knocked
over
it
causes
second
also
to
fall

animals
this
agency
is
combination
of
how
it

how

aristotle
noted
that
ground
level

aristotle
was
one
of
first
people
to
record
any
geological
observations
he
stated
that
geological
change
was
too
slow
to
be
observed
in

lifetime
the
geologist
charles

noted
that
aristotle
described
such
change
including
lakes
that
had
dried
up
and
deserts
that
had
become
watered
by
rivers
giving
as
examples
growth
of

since

of

about

including
his
major

for
example
he
made
some
of

about

forms
large
part
of
his

he
spent
two
years
observing
and
describing
zoology
of

in
particular
pyrrha

in

of

given

such
as

and

and
less
accurate
accounts
provided
by
travellers
from
overseas
his
apparent
emphasis
on
animals
rather
than
plants
is
historical
accident
his
works
on

have
been
lost

aristotle
reports
on

on

he
describes
catfish
electric

and
frogfish
in

as
well
as
cephalopods
such
as
octopus
and

nautilus
his
description
of
hectocotyl
arm
of
cephalopods
used
in
sexual
reproduction
was
widely
disbelieved
until
th
century
he
gives
accurate
descriptions
of
fourchambered

of
ruminants
and
of
ovoviviparous
embryological

of

he
notes
that
animals
structure
is
well
matched
to
function
so
among
birds
heron
which
lives
in
marshes
with
soft
mud
and
lives
by
catching
fish
has
long
neck
and
long
legs
and
sharp
spearlike
beak
whereas
ducks
that
swim
have
short
legs
and
webbed
feet
darwin
too
noted
these
sorts
of
differences
between
similar
kinds
of
animal
but
unlike
aristotle
used
data
to
come
to
theory
of
evolution
aristotles
writings
can
seem
to
modern
readers
close
to
implying
evolution
but
while
aristotle
was
aware
that
new
mutations
or
hybridizations
could
occur
he
saw
these
as
rare
accidents
for
aristotle
accidents
like
heat
waves
in
winter
must
be
considered
distinct
from
natural
causes
he
was
thus
critical
of
empedocless
materialist
theory
of
survival
of
fittest
origin
of
living
things
and
their
organs
and
ridiculed
idea
that
accidents
could
lead
to
orderly
results
to
put
his
views
into
modern
terms
he
nowhere
says
that
different
species
can
have
common
ancestor
or
that
one
kind
can
change
into
another
or
that
kinds
can
become
extinct
scientific
style
aristotle
inferred
growth
laws
from
his
observations
on
animals
including
that
brood
size
decreases
with
body
mass
whereas
gestation
period
increases
he
was
correct
in
these
predictions
at
least
for
mammals
data
are
shown
for
mouse
and
elephant
aristotle
did
not
do
experiments
in
modern
sense
he
used
ancient
greek
term
pepeiramenoi
to
mean
observations
or
at
most
investigative
procedures
like
dissection
in
generation
of
animals
he
finds
fertilized
hens
egg
of
suitable
stage
and
opens
it
to
see
embryos
heart
beating
inside
instead
he
practiced
different
style
of
science
systematically
gathering
data
discovering
patterns
common
to
whole
groups
of
animals
and
inferring
possible
causal
explanations
from
these
this
style
is
common
in
modern
biology
when
large
amounts
of
data
become
available
in
new
field
such
as
genomics
it
does
not
result
in
same
certainty
as
experimental
science
but
it
sets
out
testable
hypotheses
and
constructs
narrative
explanation
of
what
is
observed
in
this
sense
aristotles
biology
is
scientific
from
data
he
collected
and
documented
aristotle
inferred
quite
number
of
rules
relating
lifehistory
features
of
livebearing
tetrapods
terrestrial
placental
mammals
that
he
studied
among
these
correct
predictions
are
following
brood
size
decreases
with
adult
body
mass
so
that
elephant
has
fewer
young
usually
just
one
per
brood
than
mouse
lifespan
increases
with
gestation
period
and
also
with
body
mass
so
that
elephants
live
longer
than
mice
have
longer
period
of
gestation
and
are
heavier
as
final
example
fecundity
decreases
with
lifespan
so
longlived
kinds
like
elephants
have
fewer
young
in
total
than
shortlived
kinds
like

psychology

further
information
on

aristotle
proposed
threepart
structure
for
souls
of
plants
animals
and
humans
making
humans
unique
in
having
all
three
types
of
soul
aristotles

given
in
his
treatise
on
soul
peri
psychs
posits
three
kinds
of
soul
psyches
vegetative
soul
sensitive
soul
and
rational
soul
humans
have
rational
soul
the
human
soul
incorporates
powers
of
other
kinds
like
vegetative
soul
it
can
grow
and
nourish
itself
like
sensitive
soul
it
can
experience
sensations
and
move
locally
the
unique
part
of
human
rational
soul
is
its
ability
to
receive
forms
of
other
things
and
to
compare
them
using
nous
intellect
and
logos
reason
for
aristotle
soul
is
form
of
living
being
because
all
beings
are
composites
of
form
and
matter
form
of
living
beings
is
that
which
endows
them
with
what
is
specific
to
living
beings
eg
ability
to
initiate
movement
or
in
case
of
plants
growth
and
chemical
transformations
which
aristotle
considers
types
of
movement
in
contrast
to
earlier
philosophers
but
in
accordance
with
egyptians
he
placed
rational
soul
in
heart
rather
than
brain
notable
is
aristotles
division
of
sensation
and
thought
which
generally
differed
from
concepts
of
previous
philosophers
with
exception
of
alcmaeon
memory
according
to
aristotle
in
on
soul
memory
is
ability
to
hold
perceived
experience
in
mind
and
to
distinguish
between
internal
appearance
and
occurrence
in
past
in
other
words
memory
is
mental
picture
phantasm
that
can
be
recovered
aristotle
believed
impression
is
left
on
semifluid
bodily
organ
that
undergoes
several
changes
in
order
to
make
memory
a
memory
occurs
when
stimuli
such
as
sights
or
sounds
are
so
complex
that
nervous
system
cannot
receive
all
impressions
at
once
these
changes
are
same
as
those
involved
in
operations
of
sensation
aristotelian
common
sense
and
thinking
aristotle
uses
term
memory
for
actual
retaining
of
experience
in
impression
that
can
develop
from
sensation
and
for
intellectual
anxiety
that
comes
with
impression
because
it
is
formed
at
particular
time
and
processing
specific
contents
memory
is
of
past
prediction
is
of
future
and
sensation
is
of
present
retrieval
of
impressions
cannot
be
performed
suddenly
a
transitional
channel
is
needed
and
located
in
past
experiences
both
for
previous
experience
and
present
experience
because
aristotle
believes
people
receive
all
kinds
of
sense
perceptions
and
perceive
them
as
impressions
people
are
continually
weaving
together
new
impressions
of
experiences
to
search
for
these
impressions
people
search
memory
itself
within
memory
if
one
experience
is
offered
instead
of
specific
memory
that
person
will
reject
this
experience
until
they
find
what
they
are
looking
for
recollection
occurs
when
one
retrieved
experience
naturally
follows
another
if
chain
of
images
is
needed
one
memory
will
stimulate
next
when
people
recall
experiences
they
stimulate
certain
previous
experiences
until
they
reach
one
that
is
needed
recollection
is
thus
selfdirected
activity
of
retrieving
information
stored
in
memory
impression
only
humans
can
remember
impressions
of
intellectual
activity
such
as
numbers
and
words
animals
that
have
perception
of
time
can
retrieve
memories
of
their
past
observations
remembering
involves
only
perception
of
things
remembered
and
of

action
in
aristotles
psychology

in

linked
by
his
laws

and

aristotle
believed
chain
of
thought
which
ends
in
recollection
of
certain
impressions
was
connected
systematically
in
relationships
such
as
similarity
contrast
and
contiguity
described
in
his
laws
of
association
aristotle
believed
that
past
experiences
are
hidden
within
mind
a
force
operates
to
awaken
hidden
material
to
bring
up
actual
experience
according
to
aristotle
association
is
power
innate
in
mental
state
which
operates
upon
unexpressed
remains
of
former
experiences
allowing
them
to
rise
and
be
recalled
dreams
further
information
dream
classical
history
aristotle
describes
sleep
in
on
sleep
and
wakefulness
sleep
takes
place
as
result
of
overuse
of
senses
or
of
digestion
so
it
is
vital
to
body
while
person
is
asleep
critical
activities
which
include
thinking
sensing
recalling
and
remembering
do
not
function
as
they
do
during
wakefulness
since
person
cannot
sense
during
sleep
they
cannot
have
desire
which
is
result
of
sensation
however
senses
are
able
to
work
during
sleep
albeit
differently
unless
they
are
weary
dreams
do
not
involve
actually
sensing
stimulus
in
dreams
sensation
is
still
involved
but
in
altered
manner
aristotle
explains
that
when
person
stares
at
moving
stimulus
such
as
waves
in
body
of
water
and
then
looks
away
next
thing
they
look
at
appears
to
have
wavelike
motion
when
person
perceives
stimulus
and
stimulus
is
no
longer
focus
of
their
attention
it
leaves
impression
when
body
is
awake
and
senses
are
functioning
properly
person
constantly
encounters
new
stimuli
to
sense
and
so
impressions
of
previously
perceived
stimuli
are
ignored
however
during
sleep
impressions
made
throughout
day
are
noticed
as
there
are
no
new
distracting
sensory
experiences
so
dreams
result
from
these
lasting
impressions
since
impressions
are
all
that
are
left
and
not
exact
stimuli
dreams
do
not
resemble
actual
waking
experience
during
sleep
person
is
in
altered
state
of
mind
aristotle
compares
sleeping
person
to
person
who
is
overtaken
by
strong
feelings
toward
stimulus
for
example
person
who
has
strong
infatuation
with
someone
may
begin
to
think
they
see
that
person
everywhere
because
they
are
so
overtaken
by
their
feelings
since
person
sleeping
is
in
suggestible
state
and
unable
to
make
judgements
they
become
easily
deceived
by
what
appears
in
their
dreams
like
infatuated
person
this
leads
person
to
believe
dream
is
real
even
when
dreams
are
absurd
in
nature
in
de
anima
iii
aristotle
ascribes
ability
to
create
to
store
and
to
recall
images
in
absence
of
perception
to
faculty
of
imagination
phantasia
one
component
of
aristotles
theory
of
dreams
disagrees
with
previously
held
beliefs
he
claimed
that
dreams
are
not
foretelling
and
not
sent
by
divine
being
aristotle
reasoned
naturalistically
that
instances
in
which
dreams
do
resemble
future
events
are
simply
coincidences
aristotle
claimed
that
dream
is
first
established
by
fact
that
person
is
asleep
when
they
experience
it
if
person
had
image
appear
for
moment
after
waking
up
or
if
they
see
something
in
dark
it
is
not
considered
dream
because
they
were
awake
when
it
occurred
secondly
any
sensory
experience
that
is
perceived
while
person
is
asleep
does
not
qualify
as
part
of
dream
for
example
if
while
person
is
sleeping
door
shuts
and
in
their
dream
they
hear
door
is
shut
this
sensory
experience
is
not
part
of
dream
lastly
images
of
dreams
must
be
result
of
lasting
impressions
of
waking
sensory
experiences

especially
his

that

was
justified
to
enslave
natural
slaves
in
aristotelian
philosophy
abolition
of
what
he
considers
natural
slavery
would
undermine
civic
freedom
the
pursuit
of

is
inseparable
from
pursuing
mastery
over
those
who
deserve

according
to
the
cambridge

to

targets
of

aggressive
warfare

that
our

it

aristotle
generally
has
favourable
opinion
of
war
extolling
it
as
chance
for
virtue
and
writing
that
leisure
that
accompanies

tends
to
make

war
to
avoid
becoming
enslaved
to
others
is
justified
as

wrote
several
treatises
on
ethics
including
most
notably
nicomachean
ethics
aristotle
taught
that
virtue
has
to
do
with
proper
function
ergon
of

an
eye
is
only
good
eye
in
so
much
as
it
can
see
because
proper
function
of

aristotle
reasoned
that
humans
must
have
function
specific
to
humans
and
that
this
function
must
be
activity
of
psuch
soul
in

with

aristotle
identified
such
optimum
activity
virtuous
mean
between

of
excess
or
deficiency

aim
of
all

thik
aret
often
translated
as

or

aristotle
taught
that
to
achieve
virtuous
and
potentially
happy
character
requires
first
stage
of
having
fortune
to
be
habituated
not
deliberately
but
by
teachers
and
experience
leading

aristotle
in
addition
to
his
works
on
ethics
which
address
individual
aristotle
addressed
city
in
his
work
titled
politics
aristotle
considered
city
to
be
natural
community
moreover
he
considered
city
to
be
prior
in
importance
to
family
which
in
turn
is
prior
to
individual
for
whole
must
of
necessity
be
prior
to
part
he
famously
stated
that
man
is
by
nature
political
animal
and
argued
that
humanitys
defining
factor
among
others
in
animal
kingdom
is
its
rationality
aristotle
conceived
of
politics
as
being
like
organism
rather
than
like
machine
and
as
collection
of
parts
none
of
which
can
exist
without
others
aristotles
conception
of
city
is
organic
and
he
is
considered
one
of
first
to
conceive
of
city
in
this
manner
aristotles
classifications
of
political
constitutions
the
common
modern
understanding
of
political
community
as
modern
state
is
quite
different
from
aristotles
understanding
although
he
was
aware
of
existence
and
potential
of
larger
empires
natural
community
according
to
aristotle
was
city
polis
which
functions
as
political
community
or
partnership
koinnia
the
aim
of
city
is
not
just
to
avoid
injustice
or
for
economic
stability
but
rather
to
allow
at
least
some
citizens
possibility
to
live
good
life
and
to
perform
beautiful
acts
the
political
partnership
must
be
regarded
therefore
as
being
for
sake
of
noble
actions
not
for
sake
of
living
together
this
is
distinguished
from
modern
approaches
beginning
with
social
contract
theory
according
to
which
individuals
leave
state
of
nature
because
of
fear
of
violent
death
or
its
inconveniencesl
in
protrepticus
character
aristotle
states
for
we
all
agree
that
most
excellent
man
should
rule
ie
supreme
by
nature
and
that
law
rules
and
alone
is
authoritative
but
law
is
kind
of
intelligence
ie
discourse
based
on
intelligence
and
again
what
standard
do
we
have
what
criterion
of
good
things
that
is
more
precise
than
intelligent
man
for
all
that
this
man
will
choose
if
choice
is
based
on
his
knowledge
are
good
things
and
their
contraries
are
bad
and
since
everybody
chooses
most
of
all
what
conforms
to
their
own
proper
dispositions
just
man
choosing
to
live
justly
man
with
bravery
to
live
bravely
likewise
selfcontrolled
man
to
live
with
selfcontrol
it
is
clear
that
intelligent
man
will
choose
most
of
all
to
be
intelligent
for
this
is
function
of
that
capacity
hence
its
evident
that
according
to
most
authoritative
judgment
intelligence
is
supreme
among
goods
as
platos
disciple
aristotle
was
rather
skeptical
concerning
democracy
and
following
platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
it
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
this
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as

his
response
to
criticisms
of
private
property
in
lionel
robbinss
view
anticipated
later
proponents
of
private
property
among
philosophers
and
economists
as
it
related
to
overall
utility
of
social
arrangements
aristotle
believed
that
although
communal
arrangements
may
seem
beneficial
to
society
and
that
although
private
property
is
often
blamed
for
social
strife
such
evils
in
fact
come
from
human
nature
in
politics
aristotle
offers
one
of
earliest
accounts
of
origin
of
money
money
came
into
use
because
people
became
dependent
on
one
another
importing
what
they
needed
and
exporting
surplus
for

of
convenience

then

to

as

or

aristotles
discussions
on
retail
and
interest
was
major
influence
on
economic
thought
in
middle
ages
he
had
low
opinion
of
retail
believing
that
contrary
to
using
money
to
procure
things
one
needs
in
managing
household
retail
trade
seeks
to
make
profit
it
thus
uses
goods
as
means
to
end
rather
than
as
end
unto
itself
he
believed
that
retail
trade
was
in
this
way
unnatural
similarly
aristotle
considered
making
profit
through
interest
unnatural
as
it
makes
gain
out
of
money
itself
and
not
from
its
use
aristotle
gave
summary
of
function
of
money
that
was
perhaps
remarkably
precocious
for
his
time
he
wrote
that
because
it
is
impossible
to
determine
value
of
every
good
through
count
of
number
of
other
goods
it
is
worth
necessity
arises
of
single
universal
standard
of
measurement
money
thus
allows
for
association
of
different
goods
and
makes
them
commensurable
he
goes
on
to
state
that
money
is
also
useful
for
future
exchange
making
it
sort
of
security
that
is
if
we

aristotles
rhetoric
proposes
that
speaker
can
use
three
basic
kinds
of
appeals
to
persuade
his
audience
ethos
appeal
to
speakers
character
pathos
appeal
to
audiences
emotion
and
logos
appeal
to

reasoning
he
also
categorizes
rhetoric
into
three
genres
epideictic
ceremonial
speeches
dealing
with
praise
or
blame
forensic
judicial
speeches
over
guilt
or
innocence
and
deliberative
speeches
calling
on
audience
to
make
decision
on
issue
aristotle
also
outlines
two
kinds
of
rhetorical
proofs
enthymeme
proof
by
syllogism
and
paradeigma
proof
by
example
aristotle
writes
in
his
poetics
that
epic
poetry
tragedy
comedy
dithyrambic
poetry
painting
sculpture
music
and
dance
are
all
fundamentally
acts
of
mimesis
imitation
each
varying
in
imitation
by
medium
object
and
manner
he
applies
term
mimesis
both
as
property
of
work
of
art
and
also
as
product
of
artists
intention
and
contends
that
audiences
realisation
of
mimesis
is
vital
to
understanding
work
itself
aristotle
states
that
mimesis
is
natural
instinct
of
humanity
that
separates
humans
from
animals
and
that
all
human
artistry
follows
pattern
of
nature
because
of
this
aristotle
believed
that
each
of
mimetic
arts
possesses
what
stephen
halliwell
calls
highly
structured
procedures
for
achievement
of
their
purposes
for
example
music
imitates
with
media
of
rhythm
and
harmony
whereas
dance
imitates
with
rhythm
alone
and
poetry
with
language
the
forms
also
differ
in
their
object
of
imitation
comedy
for
instance
is
dramatic
imitation
of
men
worse
than
average
whereas
tragedy
imitates
men
slightly
better
than
average
lastly
forms
differ
in
their
manner
of
imitation
through
narrative
or
character
through
change
or
no
change
and
through
drama
or
no
drama
while
it
is
believed
that
aristotles
poetics
originally
comprised
two
books
one
on
comedy
and
one
on
tragedy
only
portion
that
focuses
on
tragedy
has
survived
aristotle
taught
that
tragedy
is
composed
of
six
elements
plotstructure
character
style
thought
spectacle
and
lyric
poetry
the
characters
in
tragedy
are
merely
means
of
driving
story
and
plot
not
characters
is
chief
focus
of
tragedy
tragedy
is
imitation
of
action
arousing
pity
and
fear
and
is
meant
to
effect
catharsis
of
those
same
emotions
aristotle
concludes
poetics
with
discussion
on
which
if
either
is
superior
epic
or
tragic
mimesis
he
suggests
that
because
tragedy
possesses
all
attributes
of
epic
possibly
possesses
additional
attributes
such
as
spectacle
and
music
is
more
unified
and
achieves
aim
of
its
mimesis
in
shorter
scope
it
can
be
considered
superior
to
epic

william

showed
that

circulated
contrary
to

era
thinking
in
early
modern
period
scientists
such
as
william
harvey
in
england
and
galileo
galilei
in
italy
reacted
against
theories
of
aristotle
and
other
classical
era
thinkers
like
galen
establishing
new
theories
based
to
some
degree
on
observation
and
experiment
harvey
demonstrated
circulation
of
blood
establishing
that
heart
functioned
as
pump
rather
than
being
seat
of
soul
and
controller
of
bodys
heat
as
aristotle
thought
galileo
used
more
doubtful
arguments
to
displace
aristotles
physics
proposing
that
bodies
all
fall
at
same
speed
whatever
their
weight
on
thcentury
thinkers
the
thcentury
german
philosopher
friedrich
nietzsche
has
been
said
to
have
taken
nearly
all
of
his
political
philosophy
from
aristotle
aristotle
rigidly
separated
action
from
production
and
argued
for
deserved
subservience
of
some
people
natural
slaves
and
natural
superiority
virtue
arete
of
others
it
was
martin
heidegger
not
nietzsche
who
elaborated
new
interpretation
of
aristotle
intended
to
warrant
his
deconstruction
of
scholastic
and
philosophical
tradition
the
english
mathematician
george
boole
fully
accepted
aristotles
logic
but
decided
to
go
under
over
and
beyond
it
with
his
system
of
algebraic
logic
in
his
book
the
laws
of
thought
this
gives
logic
mathematical
foundation
with
equations
enables
it
to
solve
equations
as
well
as
check
validity
and
allows
it
to
handle
wider
class
of
problems
by
expanding
propositions

laplante
fr
during
th
century
aristotles
work
was
widely
criticized
the
philosopher
bertrand
russell
argued
that
almost
every
serious
intellectual
advance
has
had
to
begin
with
attack
on
some
aristotelian
doctrine
russell
called
aristotles
ethics
repulsive
and
labelled
his
logic
as
definitely
antiquated
as
ptolemaic
astronomy
russell
stated
that
these
errors
made
it
difficult
to
do
historical
justice
to
aristotle
until
one
remembered
what
advance
he
made
upon
all
of
his
predecessors
the
dutch
historian
of
science
eduard
jan
dijksterhuis
wrote
that
aristotle
and
his
predecessors
showed
difficulty
of
science
by
proceeding
so
readily
to
frame
theory
of
such
general
character
on
limited
evidence
from
their
senses
in
biologist
peter
medawar
could
still
state
in
pure
seventeenth
century
tones
that
aristotle
had
assembled
strange
and
generally
speaking
rather
tiresome
farrago
of
hearsay
imperfect
observation
wishful
thinking
and
credulity
amounting
to
downright
gullibility
by
start
of
st
century
however
aristotle
was
taken
more
seriously
kukkonen
noted
that
in
best
thcentury
scholarship
aristotle
comes
alive
as
thinker
wrestling
with
full
weight
of
greek
philosophical
tradition
alasdair
macintyre
has
attempted
to
reform
what
he
calls
aristotelian
tradition
in
way
that
is
antielitist
and
capable
of
disputing
claims
of
both
liberals
and
nietzscheans
kukkonen
observed
too
that
that
most
enduring
of
romantic
images
aristotle
tutoring
future
conqueror
alexander
remained
current
as
in
film
alexander
while
firm
rules

theory

a
major
question
in
history
of
aristotles
works
is
how
exoteric
writings
were
all
lost
and
how
ones
now
possessed
came
to
be
found
the
consensus
is
that
andronicus
of
rhodes
collected
esoteric
works
of
aristotles
school
which
existed
in
form
of
smaller
separate
works
distinguished
them
from
those
of
theophrastus
and
other
peripatetics
edited
them
and
finally
compiled
them
into
more
cohesive

stated
drabkin
quotes
numerous
passages
from

and
on

de

which
state
aristotles
laws

drabkin
agrees
that
density
is
treated
quantitatively
in
this
passage
but
without
sharp
definition
of
density
as
weight
per

volume
philoponus

galileo
correctly
objected
that

phase
still
increasing

apply
galileo
used

this
rovelli
notes
that
two
heavy
balls
with

shape

do
fall

aristotle
provided
complex
synthesis
of
various
philosophies
existing
prior
to
him
it
was
above
all
from
his
teachings
that
west
inherited
its
intellectual
lexicon
as
well
as
problems
and
methods
of
inquiry
as
result
his
philosophy
has
exerted
unique
influence
on
almost
every
form
of
knowledge
in
west
and
it
continues
to
be
subject
of
contemporary
philosophical
discussion
little
is
known
about
his
life
aristotle
was
born
in
city
of
stagira
in
northern
greece
his
father
nicomachus
died
when
aristotle
was
child
and
he
was
brought
up
by
guardian
at
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
he
joined
platos
academy
in
athens
and
remained
there
until
age
of
thirtyseven
c
bc
shortly
after

died
aristotle
left
athens
and
at
request
of
philip
ii
of
macedon
tutored
alexander
great
beginning
in
bc
he
established
library
in
lyceum
which
helped
him
to
produce
many
of
his
hundreds
of
books
on
papyrus
scrolls
though
aristotle
wrote
many
elegant
treatises
and
dialogues
for
publication
only
around
third
of
his
original
output
has
survived
none
of
it

aristotles
views
on
physical
science
profoundly
shaped
medieval
scholarship
their
influence
extended
from
late
antiquity
and
early
middle
ages
into
renaissance
and
were
not
replaced
systematically
until
enlightenment
and
theories
such
as
classical
mechanics
were
developed
some
of
aristotles
zoological
observations
found
in
his
biology
such
as
on
hectocotyl
reproductive
arm
of
octopus
were
disbelieved
until
th
century
his
works
contain
earliest
known
formal
study
of
logic
studied
by
medieval
scholars
such
as
peter
abelard
and
john
buridan
aristotles
influence
on
logic
also
continued
well
into
th
century
he
influenced
judeoislamic
philosophies
during
middle
ages
as
well
as
christian
theology
especially
neoplatonism
of
early
church
and
scholastic
tradition
of
catholic
church
aristotle
was
revered
among
medieval
muslim
scholars
as
the
first
teacher
and
among

aristotle
the
word
metaphysics
appears
to
have
been
coined
by
first
century
ad
editor
who
assembled
various
small
selections
of
aristotles
works
to
treatise
we
know
by
name
metaphysics
aristotle
called
it
first
philosophy
and
distinguished
it
from
mathematics
and
natural
science
physics
as
contemplative
theoretik
philosophy
which
is
theological
and
studies
divine
he
wrote
in
his
metaphysics
a
if
there
were
no
other
independent
things
besides
composite
natural
ones
study
of
nature
would
be
primary
kind
of
knowledge
but
if
there
is
some
motionless
independent
thing
knowledge
of
this
precedes
it
and
is
first
philosophy
and
it
is
universal
in
just
this
way
because
it
is
first
and
it
belongs
to
this
sort
of
philosophy
to
study
being
as
being
both
what
it
is
and
what
belongs
to
it

and
he
concludes
that

substance
is

of
both
matter
and

philosophical
theory
called
hylomorphism
in
book
viii
he
distinguishes
matter
of

as

which
it

for
example
matter
of
house
is
bricks

both
matter
and

belong

his

plato
aristotles
philosophy
aims
at
universal
aristotles
ontology
places
universal
katholou
in
particulars
kath
hekaston
things
in

whereas
for
plato
universal
is
separately
existing
form
which
actual
things
imitate
for
aristotle
form
is
still
what
phenomena
are
based
on
but
is
instantiated
in
particular
substance
plato
argued
that
all
things
have
universal
form
which
could
be
either
property
or
relation
to
other
things
when
one
looks
at
apple
for
example
one
sees
apple
and
one
can
also
analyse
form
of
apple
in
this
distinction
there
is
particular
apple
and
universal
form
of
apple
moreover
one
can
place
apple
next
to
book
so
that
one
can
speak
of
both
book
and
apple
as
being
next
to
each
other
plato
argued
that
there
are
some
universal
forms
that
are
not
part
of
particular
things
for
example
it
is
possible
that
there
is
no
particular
good
in
existence
but
good
is
still
proper
universal
form
aristotle
disagreed
with
plato
on
this
point
arguing
that
all
universals
are
instantiated
at
some
period
of
time
and
that
there
are
no
universals
that
are
unattached
to
existing
things
in
addition
aristotle
disagreed
with
plato
about
location
of
universals
where
plato
spoke
of
world
of
forms
place
where
all
universal
forms
subsist
aristotle
maintained
that
universals
exist
within
each
thing
on
which
each
universal
is
predicated
so
according
to
aristotle
form
of
apple
exists
within
each
apple

than
in

potentiality
and

aristotle
with
regard
to
change
kinesis
and
its
causes
now
as
he
defines
in
his
physics
and
on
generation
and
corruption
ba
he
distinguishes
coming
to
be
from
growth
and
diminution
which
is
change
in
quantity
locomotion
which
is
change
in
space
and
alteration
which
is
change
in
quality
aristotle
argued
that
capability
like
playing
flute
could
be
acquired
potential
made
actual
by
learning
the
coming
to
be
is
change
where
nothing
persists
of
which
resultant
is
property
in
that
particular
change
he
introduces
concept
of
potentiality
dynamis
and
actuality
entelecheia
in
association
with
matter
and
form
referring
to
potentiality
this
is
what
thing
is
capable
of
doing
or
being
acted
upon
if
conditions
are
right
and
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
else
for
example
seed
of
plant
in
soil
is
potentially
dynamei
plant
and
if
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
it
will
become
plant
potentially
beings
can
either
act
poiein
or
be
acted
upon
paschein
which
can
be
either
innate
or
learned
for
example
eyes
possess
potentiality
of
sight
innate
being
acted
upon
while
capability
of
playing
flute
can
be
possessed
by
learning
exercise
acting
actuality
is
fulfilment
of
end
of
potentiality
because
end
telos
is
principle
of
every
change
and
for
sake
of
end
exists
potentiality
therefore
actuality
is
end
referring
then
to
previous
example
it
can
be
said
that
actuality
is
when
plant
does
one
of
activities
that
plants
do
for
that
for
sake
of
which
to
hou
heneka
thing
is
is
its
principle
and
becoming
is
for
sake
of
end
and
actuality
is
end
and
it
is
for
sake
of
this
that
potentiality
is
acquired
for
animals
do
not
see
in
order
that
they
may
have
sight
but
they
have
sight
that
they
may
see
in
summary
matter
used
to
make
house
has
potentiality
to
be
house
and
both
activity
of
building
and
form
of
final
house
are
actualities
which
is
also
final
cause
or
end
then
aristotle
proceeds
and
concludes
that
actuality
is
prior
to
potentiality
in
formula
in
time
and
in
substantiality
with
this
definition
of
particular
substance
ie
matter
and
form
aristotle
tries
to
solve
problem
of
unity
of
beings
for
example
what
is
it
that
makes
man
one
since
according
to
plato
there
are
two
ideas
animal
and
biped
how
then
is
man
unity
however
according
to
aristotle
potential
being
matter
and
actual
one
form
are
one
and
same
epistemology
aristotles
immanent
realism
means
his
epistemology
is
based
on
study
of
things
that
exist
or
happen
in
world
and
rises
to
knowledge
of
universal
whereas
for
plato
epistemology
begins
with
knowledge
of
universal
forms
or
ideas
and
descends
to
knowledge
of
particular
imitations
of
these
aristotle
uses
induction
from
examples
alongside
deduction

plato

that
agents
effect
stops
immediately
it
stops
acting
eg
ball

throwers
hand
has

he
has
to

to

along
to
make

continue
to
rise
even
though

is
no

four

main

four
causes
aristotle
argued
by
analogy
with
woodwork
that
thing
takes
its
form
from
four
causes
in
case
of
table
wood
used
material
cause
its
design
formal
cause
tools
and
techniques
used
efficient
cause
and
its
decorative
or
practical
purpose
final
cause
aristotle
suggested
that
reason
for
anything
coming
about
can
be
attributed
to
four
different
types
of
simultaneously
active
factors
his
term
aitia
is
traditionally
translated
as
cause
but
it
does
not
always
refer
to
temporal
sequence
it
might
be
better
translated
as
explanation
but
traditional
rendering
will
be
employed
here
material
cause
describes
material
out
of
which
something
is
composed
thus
material
cause
of
table
is
wood
it
is
not
about
action
it
does
not
mean
that
one
domino
knocks
over
another
domino
the
formal
cause
is
its
form
ie
arrangement
of
that
matter
it
tells
one
what
thing
is
that
thing
is
determined
by
definition
form
pattern
essence
whole
synthesis
or
archetype
it
embraces
account
of
causes
in
terms
of
fundamental
principles
or
general
laws
as
whole
ie
macrostructure
is
cause
of
its
parts
relationship
known
as
wholepart
causation
plainly
put
formal
cause
is
idea
in
mind
of
sculptor
that
brings
sculpture
into
being
a
simple
example
of
formal
cause
is
mental
image
or
idea
that
allows
artist
architect
or
engineer
to
create
drawing
the
efficient
cause
is
primary
source
or
that
from
which
change
under
consideration
proceeds
it
identifies
what
makes
of
what
is
made
and
what
causes
change
of
what
is
changed
and
so
suggests
all
sorts
of
agents
nonliving
or
living
acting
as
sources
of
change
or
movement
or
rest
representing
current
understanding
of
causality
as
relation
of
cause
and
effect
this
covers
modern
definitions
of
cause
as
either
agent
or
agency
or
particular
events
or
states
of
affairs
in
case
of
two
dominoes
when
first
is
knocked
over
it
causes
second
also
to
fall
over
in
case
of
animals
this
agency
is
combination
of
how
it
develops
from
egg
and
how
its
body
functions
the
final
cause
telos
is
its
purpose
reason
why
thing
exists
or
is
done
including
both
purposeful
and
instrumental
actions
and
activities
the
final
cause
is
purpose
or
function
that
something
is
supposed
to
serve
this
covers
modern
ideas
of
motivating
causes
such
as
volition
in
case
of
living
things
it
implies
adaptation
to
particular
way
of
life

according
to

spontaneity
and
chance
are
causes
of
some
things
distinguishable
from
other
types
of
cause
such
as
simple
necessity
chance
as
incidental
cause
lies
in

of

things
from
what
is

there

aristotle

that
ground

aristotle
was
one
of
first
people
to
record
any
geological
observations
he
stated
that
geological
change
was
too
slow
to
be
observed
in
one
persons
lifetime
the
geologist
charles
lyell
noted
that
aristotle
described
such
change
including
lakes
that
had
dried
up
and
deserts
that
had
become
watered
by
rivers
giving
as
examples
growth
of
nile
delta
since
time
of
homer
and
upheaving
of
one
of
aeolian
islands
previous
to

aristotle
also
made
many
observations
about
hydrologic
cycle
and
meteorology
including
his
major
writings
meteorologica
for
example
he
made
some
of
earliest
observations
about

he
observed
early
and
correctly
that

systematically
and

forms
large
part
of
his

he
spent
two
years
observing
and
describing
zoology
of

and
surrounding

in
particular
pyrrha

in

of

given
by
people
with
specialized
knowledge
such
as
beekeepers
and
fishermen
and
less
accurate
accounts
provided
by
travellers
from
overseas
his
apparent
emphasis
on
animals
rather
than
plants
is
historical
accident
his
works
on
botany
have
been
lost
but
two
books
on

by
his
pupil
theophrastus
have
survived
aristotle
reports
on
sealife
visible
from
observation
on

of
fishermen
he
describes
catfish
electric
ray
and
frogfish
in
detail
as
well
as
cephalopods
such
as
octopus
and
paper
nautilus
his
description
of
hectocotyl
arm
of
cephalopods
used
in
sexual
reproduction
was
widely
disbelieved
until
th
century
he
gives
accurate
descriptions
of
fourchambered
forestomachs
of
ruminants
and
of
ovoviviparous
embryological

of

he
notes
that
animals
structure
is
well
matched
to
function
so
among
birds
heron
which
lives
in
marshes
with
soft
mud
and
lives
by
catching
fish
has
long
neck
and
long
legs
and
sharp
spearlike
beak
whereas
ducks
that
swim
have
short
legs
and
webbed
feet
darwin
too
noted
these
sorts
of
differences
between
similar
kinds
of
animal
but
unlike
aristotle
used
data
to
come
to
theory
of
evolution
aristotles
writings
can
seem
to
modern
readers
close
to
implying
evolution
but
while
aristotle
was
aware
that
new
mutations
or
hybridizations
could
occur
he
saw
these
as
rare
accidents
for
aristotle
accidents
like
heat
waves
in
winter
must
be
considered
distinct
from
natural
causes
he
was
thus
critical
of
empedocless
materialist
theory
of
survival
of
fittest
origin
of
living
things
and
their
organs
and
ridiculed
idea
that
accidents
could
lead
to
orderly
results
to
put
his
views
into
modern
terms
he
nowhere
says
that
different
species
can
have
common
ancestor
or
that
one
kind
can
change
into
another
or
that
kinds
can
become
extinct
scientific
style
aristotle
inferred
growth
laws
from
his
observations
on
animals
including
that
brood
size
decreases
with
body
mass
whereas
gestation
period
increases
he
was
correct
in
these
predictions
at
least
for
mammals
data
are
shown
for
mouse
and
elephant
aristotle
did
not
do
experiments
in
modern
sense
he
used
ancient
greek
term
pepeiramenoi
to
mean
observations
or
at
most
investigative
procedures
like
dissection
in
generation
of
animals
he
finds
fertilized
hens
egg
of
suitable
stage
and
opens
it
to
see
embryos
heart
beating
inside
instead
he
practiced
different
style
of
science
systematically
gathering
data
discovering
patterns
common
to
whole
groups
of
animals
and
inferring
possible
causal
explanations
from
these
this
style
is
common
in
modern
biology
when
large
amounts
of
data
become
available
in
new
field
such
as
genomics
it
does
not
result
in
same
certainty
as
experimental
science
but
it
sets
out
testable
hypotheses
and
constructs
narrative
explanation
of
what
is
observed
in
this
sense
aristotles
biology
is
scientific
from
data
he
collected
and
documented
aristotle
inferred
quite
number
of
rules
relating
lifehistory
features
of
livebearing
tetrapods
terrestrial
placental
mammals
that
he
studied
among
these
correct
predictions
are
following
brood
size
decreases
with
adult
body
mass
so
that
elephant
has
fewer
young
usually
just
one
per
brood
than
mouse
lifespan
increases
with
gestation
period
and
also
with
body
mass
so
that
elephants
live
longer
than
mice
have
longer
period
of
gestation
and
are
heavier
as
final
example
fecundity
decreases
with
lifespan
so
longlived
kinds
like
elephants
have
fewer
young
in
total
than
shortlived
kinds
like
mice

aristotle
proposed
threepart
structure
for

of

making
humans

in
having

his

soul
peri
psychs
posits
three
kinds
of
soul
psyches
vegetative
soul
sensitive
soul
and
rational
soul
humans
have
rational
soul
the
human
soul
incorporates
powers
of
other
kinds
like
vegetative
soul
it
can
grow
and
nourish
itself
like
sensitive
soul
it
can
experience
sensations
and
move
locally
the
unique
part
of
human
rational
soul
is
its
ability
to
receive
forms
of
other
things
and
to
compare
them
using
nous
intellect
and
logos
reason
for
aristotle
soul
is
form
of
living
being
because
all
beings
are
composites
of
form
and
matter
form
of
living
beings
is
that
which
endows
them
with
what
is
specific
to
living
beings
eg
ability
to
initiate
movement
or
in
case
of
plants
growth
and
chemical
transformations
which
aristotle
considers
types
of
movement
in
contrast
to
earlier
philosophers
but
in
accordance
with
egyptians
he
placed
rational
soul
in
heart
rather
than
brain
notable
is
aristotles
division
of
sensation
and
thought
which
generally
differed
from
concepts
of
previous
philosophers
with
exception
of
alcmaeon
memory
according
to
aristotle
in
on
soul
memory
is
ability
to
hold
perceived
experience
in
mind
and
to
distinguish
between
internal
appearance
and
occurrence
in
past
in
other
words
memory
is
mental
picture
phantasm
that
can
be
recovered
aristotle
believed
impression
is
left
on
semifluid
bodily
organ
that
undergoes
several
changes
in
order
to
make
memory
a
memory
occurs
when
stimuli
such
as
sights
or
sounds
are
so
complex
that
nervous
system
cannot
receive
all
impressions
at
once
these
changes
are
same
as
those
involved
in
operations
of
sensation
aristotelian
common
sense
and
thinking
aristotle
uses
term
memory
for
actual
retaining
of
experience
in
impression
that
can
develop
from
sensation
and
for
intellectual
anxiety
that
comes
with
impression
because
it
is
formed
at
particular
time
and
processing
specific
contents
memory
is
of
past
prediction
is
of
future
and
sensation
is
of
present
retrieval
of
impressions
cannot
be
performed
suddenly
a
transitional
channel
is
needed
and
located
in
past
experiences
both
for
previous
experience
and
present
experience
because
aristotle
believes
people
receive
all
kinds
of
sense
perceptions
and
perceive
them
as
impressions
people
are
continually
weaving
together
new
impressions
of
experiences
to
search
for
these
impressions
people
search
memory
itself
within
memory
if
one
experience
is
offered
instead
of
specific
memory
that
person
will
reject
this
experience
until
they
find
what
they
are
looking
for
recollection
occurs
when
one
retrieved
experience
naturally
follows
another
if
chain
of
images
is
needed
one
memory
will
stimulate
next
when
people
recall
experiences
they
stimulate
certain
previous
experiences
until
they
reach
one
that
is
needed
recollection
is
thus
selfdirected
activity
of
retrieving
information
stored
in
memory
impression
only
humans
can
remember
impressions
of
intellectual
activity
such
as
numbers
and
words
animals
that
have
perception
of
time
can
retrieve
memories
of
their
past
observations
remembering
involves
only
perception
of
things
remembered
and
of
time

in
aristotles
psychology

aristotle
believed
chain
of
thought
which
ends
in
recollection
of
certain
impressions
was
connected
systematically
in
relationships
such
as
similarity
contrast
and
contiguity
described
in
his
laws
of
association
aristotle
believed
that
past
experiences
are
hidden
within
mind
a
force
operates
to
awaken
hidden
material
to
bring
up
actual
experience
according
to
aristotle
association
is
power
innate
in
mental
state
which
operates
upon
unexpressed
remains
of
former
experiences
allowing
them
to
rise
and
be
recalled
dreams
further
information
dream
classical
history
aristotle
describes
sleep
in
on
sleep
and
wakefulness
sleep
takes
place
as
result
of
overuse
of
senses
or
of
digestion
so
it
is
vital
to
body
while
person
is
asleep
critical
activities
which
include
thinking
sensing
recalling
and
remembering
do
not
function
as
they
do
during
wakefulness
since
person
cannot
sense
during
sleep
they
cannot
have
desire
which
is
result
of
sensation
however
senses
are
able
to
work
during
sleep
albeit
differently
unless
they
are
weary
dreams
do
not
involve
actually
sensing
stimulus
in
dreams
sensation
is
still
involved
but
in
altered
manner
aristotle
explains
that
when
person
stares
at
moving
stimulus
such
as
waves
in
body
of
water
and
then
looks
away
next
thing
they
look
at
appears
to
have
wavelike
motion
when
person
perceives
stimulus
and
stimulus
is
no
longer
focus
of
their
attention
it
leaves
impression
when
body
is
awake
and
senses
are
functioning
properly
person
constantly
encounters
new
stimuli
to
sense
and
so
impressions
of
previously
perceived
stimuli
are
ignored
however
during
sleep
impressions
made
throughout
day
are
noticed
as
there
are
no
new
distracting
sensory
experiences
so
dreams
result
from
these
lasting
impressions
since
impressions
are
all
that
are
left
and
not
exact
stimuli
dreams
do
not
resemble
actual
waking
experience
during
sleep
person
is
in
altered
state
of
mind

compares
sleeping
person
to
person
who
is
overtaken
by
strong
feelings
toward
stimulus
for
example
person
who
has
strong
infatuation
with
someone
may
begin
to
think
they
see
that
person
everywhere
because
they
are
so
overtaken
by
their
feelings
since
person
sleeping
is
in
suggestible
state
and
unable
to
make
judgements
they
become
easily
deceived
by
what
appears
in
their
dreams
like
infatuated
person
this
leads
person
to
believe
dream
is
real
even
when
dreams
are
absurd

aristotle
ascribes
ability
to
create
to
store
and
to
recall
images
in
absence
of
perception
to
faculty
of
imagination
phantasia
one
component
of
aristotles
theory
of
dreams
disagrees
with
previously
held
beliefs
he
claimed
that
dreams
are
not
foretelling
and
not
sent
by
divine
being
aristotle
reasoned
naturalistically
that
instances
in
which
dreams
do
resemble
future
events
are
simply
coincidences
aristotle
claimed
that
dream
is
first
established
by
fact
that
person
is
asleep
when
they
experience
it
if
person
had
image
appear
for
moment
after
waking
up
or
if
they
see
something
in
dark
it
is
not
considered
dream
because
they
were
awake
when
it
occurred
secondly
any
sensory
experience
that
is
perceived
while
person
is
asleep
does
not
qualify
as
part
of
dream
for
example
if
while
person
is
sleeping
door
shuts
and
in
their
dream
they
hear
door
is
shut
this
sensory
experience
is
not
part
of
dream
lastly
images
of
dreams
must
be
result
of
lasting
impressions
of
waking
sensory
experiences

especially
his

that

was
justified
to
enslave
natural
slaves
in
aristotelian
philosophy
abolition
of
what
he
considers
natural
slavery
would
undermine
civic

the
pursuit
of
freedom
is
inseparable
from
pursuing
mastery
over
those
who
deserve
to
be

according
to
the

generally

favourable
opinion
of

extolling
it
as

for

writing
that

that

tends
to

war
to

main
article
aristotelian
ethics
aristotle
considered
ethics
to
be
practical
rather
than
theoretical
study
ie
one
aimed
at
becoming
good
and
doing
good
rather
than
knowing
for
its
own
sake
he
wrote
several
treatises
on
ethics
including
most
notably
nicomachean
ethics
aristotle
taught
that
virtue
has
to
do
with
proper
function
ergon
of
thing
an
eye
is
only
good
eye
in
so
much
as
it
can
see
because
proper
function
of
eye
is
sight
aristotle
reasoned
that
humans
must
have
function
specific
to
humans
and
that
this
function
must
be
activity
of
psuch
soul
in
accordance
with
reason
logos
aristotle
identified
such
optimum
activity
virtuous
mean
between
accompanying
vices
of
excess
or
deficiency
of
soul
as
aim
of
all
human
deliberate
action
eudaimonia
generally
translated
as
happiness
or
sometimes
well
being
to
have
potential
of
ever
being
happy
in
this
way
necessarily
requires
good
character
thik
aret
often
translated
as
moral
or
ethical
virtue
or
excellence
aristotle
taught
that
to
achieve
virtuous
and
potentially
happy
character
requires
first
stage
of
having
fortune
to
be
habituated
not
deliberately
but
by
teachers
and
experience
leading
to
later
stage
in
which
one
consciously
chooses
to
do
best
things
when
best
people
come
to
live
life
this
way
their
practical
wisdom

and
their

main
article
politics
aristotle
in
addition
to
his
works
on
ethics
which
address
individual
aristotle
addressed
city
in
his
work
titled
politics
aristotle
considered
city
to
be
natural
community
moreover
he
considered
city
to
be
prior
in
importance
to
family
which
in
turn
is
prior
to
individual
for
whole
must
of
necessity
be
prior
to
part
he
famously
stated
that
man
is
by
nature
political
animal
and
argued
that
humanitys
defining
factor
among
others
in
animal
kingdom
is
its
rationality
aristotle
conceived
of
politics
as
being
like
organism
rather
than
like
machine
and
as
collection
of
parts
none
of
which
can
exist
without
others
aristotles
conception
of
city
is
organic
and
he
is
considered
one
of
first
to
conceive
of
city
in
this
manner
aristotles
classifications
of
political
constitutions
the
common
modern
understanding
of
political
community
as
modern
state
is
quite
different
from
aristotles
understanding
although
he
was
aware
of
existence
and
potential
of
larger
empires
natural
community
according
to
aristotle
was
city
polis
which
functions
as
political
community
or
partnership
koinnia
the
aim
of
city
is
not
just
to
avoid
injustice
or
for
economic
stability
but
rather
to
allow
at
least
some
citizens
possibility
to
live
good
life
and
to
perform
beautiful
acts
the
political
partnership
must
be
regarded
therefore
as
being
for
sake
of
noble
actions
not
for
sake
of
living
together
this
is
distinguished
from
modern
approaches
beginning
with
social
contract
theory
according
to
which
individuals
leave
state
of
nature
because
of
fear
of
violent
death
or
its
inconveniencesl
in
protrepticus
character
aristotle
states
for
we
all
agree
that
most
excellent
man
should
rule
ie
supreme
by
nature
and
that
law
rules
and
alone
is
authoritative
but
law
is
kind
of
intelligence
ie
discourse
based
on
intelligence
and
again
what
standard
do
we
have
what
criterion
of
good
things
that
is
more
precise
than
intelligent
man
for
all
that
this
man
will
choose
if
choice
is
based
on
his
knowledge
are
good
things
and
their
contraries
are
bad
and
since
everybody
chooses
most
of
all
what
conforms
to
their
own
proper
dispositions
just
man
choosing
to
live
justly
man
with
bravery
to
live
bravely
likewise
selfcontrolled
man
to
live
with
selfcontrol
it
is
clear
that
intelligent
man
will
choose
most
of
all
to
be
intelligent
for
this
is
function
of
that
capacity
hence
its
evident
that
according
to
most
authoritative
judgment
intelligence
is
supreme
among
goods
as
platos
disciple
aristotle
was
rather
skeptical
concerning
democracy
and
following
platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
it
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
this
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as

his
response
to
criticisms
of
private
property
in
lionel
robbinss
view
anticipated
later
proponents
of
private
property
among
philosophers
and
economists
as
it
related
to
overall
utility
of
social
arrangements
aristotle
believed
that
although
communal
arrangements
may
seem
beneficial
to
society
and
that
although
private
property
is
often
blamed
for
social
strife
such
evils
in
fact
come
from
human
nature
in
politics
aristotle
offers
one
of
earliest
accounts
of
origin
of
money
money
came
into
use
because
people
became
dependent
on
one
another
importing
what
they
needed
and
exporting
surplus
for
sake
of
convenience
people
then
agreed
to

in

that

applicable
such
as

or
silver
aristotles
discussions
on
retail
and
interest
was
major
influence
on
economic
thought
in
middle
ages
he
had
low
opinion
of
retail
believing
that
contrary
to
using
money
to
procure
things
one
needs
in
managing
household
retail
trade
seeks
to
make
profit
it
thus
uses
goods
as
means
to
end
rather
than
as
end
unto
itself
he
believed
that
retail
trade
was
in
this
way
unnatural
similarly
aristotle
considered
making
profit
through
interest
unnatural
as
it
makes
gain
out
of
money
itself
and
not
from
its
use
aristotle
gave
summary
of
function
of
money
that
was
perhaps
remarkably
precocious
for
his
time
he
wrote
that
because
it
is
impossible
to
determine
value
of
every
good
through
count
of
number
of
other
goods
it
is
worth
necessity
arises
of
single
universal
standard
of
measurement
money
thus
allows
for
association
of
different
goods
and
makes
them
commensurable
he
goes
on
to
state
that
money
is
also
useful
for
future
exchange
making
it
sort
of
security
that
is
if
we

in

aristotle
uses
tragedy
oedipus

by

as
example
of
how
perfect
tragedy
should
be
structured
with
generally
good

aristotles
rhetoric
proposes
that
speaker
can
use
three
basic
kinds
of
appeals
to
persuade
his
audience
ethos
appeal
to
speakers
character
pathos
appeal
to
audiences
emotion
and
logos
appeal
to
logical
reasoning
he
also
categorizes
rhetoric
into
three
genres
epideictic
ceremonial
speeches
dealing
with
praise
or
blame
forensic
judicial
speeches
over
guilt
or
innocence
and
deliberative
speeches
calling
on
audience
to
make
decision
on
issue
aristotle
also
outlines
two
kinds
of
rhetorical
proofs
enthymeme
proof
by
syllogism
and
paradeigma
proof
by
example
aristotle
writes
in
his
poetics
that
epic
poetry
tragedy
comedy
dithyrambic
poetry
painting
sculpture
music
and
dance
are
all
fundamentally
acts
of
mimesis
imitation
each
varying
in
imitation
by
medium
object
and
manner
he
applies
term
mimesis
both
as
property
of
work
of
art
and
also
as
product
of
artists
intention
and
contends
that
audiences
realisation
of
mimesis
is
vital
to
understanding
work
itself
aristotle
states
that
mimesis
is
natural
instinct
of
humanity
that
separates
humans
from
animals
and
that
all
human
artistry
follows
pattern
of
nature
because
of
this
aristotle
believed
that
each
of
mimetic
arts
possesses
what
stephen
halliwell
calls
highly
structured
procedures
for
achievement
of
their
purposes
for
example
music
imitates
with
media
of
rhythm
and
harmony
whereas
dance
imitates
with
rhythm
alone
and
poetry
with
language
the
forms
also
differ
in
their
object
of
imitation
comedy
for
instance
is
dramatic
imitation
of
men
worse
than
average
whereas
tragedy
imitates
men
slightly
better
than
average
lastly
forms
differ
in
their
manner
of
imitation
through
narrative
or
character
through
change
or
no
change
and
through
drama
or
no
drama
while
it
is
believed
that
aristotles
poetics
originally
comprised
two
books
one
on
comedy
and
one
on
tragedy
only
portion
that
focuses
on
tragedy
has
survived
aristotle
taught
that
tragedy
is
composed
of
six
elements
plotstructure
character
style
thought
spectacle
and
lyric
poetry
the
characters
in
tragedy
are
merely
means
of
driving
story
and
plot
not
characters
is
chief
focus
of
tragedy
tragedy
is
imitation
of
action
arousing
pity
and
fear
and
is
meant
to
effect
catharsis
of
those
same
emotions
aristotle
concludes
poetics
with
discussion
on
which
if
either
is
superior
epic
or
tragic
mimesis
he
suggests
that
because
tragedy
possesses
all
attributes
of
epic
possibly
possesses
additional
attributes
such
as
spectacle
and
music
is
more
unified
and
achieves
aim
of
its
mimesis
in
shorter
scope
it
can
be
considered
superior
to
epic

the
thcentury
german

friedrich
nietzsche
has
been
said
to
have
taken
nearly
all
of

from

subservience
of

it
was
martin
heidegger
not
nietzsche
who
elaborated

interpretation
of
aristotle

to
warrant
his
deconstruction
of
scholastic
and
philosophical
tradition
the
english
mathematician
george
boole
fully
accepted
aristotles
logic
but
decided
to
go
under
over
and
beyond
it
with
his
system
of

logic
in

this

fr
during
th
century
aristotles
work
was
widely
criticized
the
philosopher
bertrand
russell
argued
that
almost
every
serious
intellectual
advance
has
had
to
begin
with
attack
on
some
aristotelian
doctrine
russell
called
aristotles
ethics
repulsive
and
labelled
his
logic
as
definitely
antiquated
as
ptolemaic
astronomy
russell
stated
that
these
errors
made
it
difficult
to
do
historical
justice
to
aristotle
until
one
remembered
what
advance
he
made
upon
all
of
his
predecessors
the
dutch
historian
of
science
eduard
jan
dijksterhuis
wrote
that
aristotle
and
his
predecessors
showed
difficulty
of
science
by
proceeding
so
readily
to
frame
theory
of
such
general
character
on
limited
evidence
from
their
senses
in
biologist
peter
medawar
could
still
state
in
pure
seventeenth
century
tones
that
aristotle
had
assembled
strange
and
generally
speaking
rather
tiresome
farrago
of
hearsay
imperfect
observation
wishful
thinking
and
credulity
amounting
to
downright
gullibility
by
start
of
st
century
however
aristotle
was
taken
more
seriously
kukkonen
noted
that
in
best
thcentury
scholarship
aristotle
comes
alive
as
thinker
wrestling
with
full
weight
of
greek
philosophical
tradition
alasdair
macintyre
has
attempted
to
reform
what
he
calls
aristotelian
tradition
in
way
that
is
antielitist
and
capable
of
disputing
claims
of
both
liberals
and
nietzscheans
kukkonen
observed
too
that

the
school
of
athens
is
one
of
group
of
four
main
frescoes
on
walls
of
stanza
those
on
either
side
centrally
interrupted
by
windows
that
depict
distinct
branches
of
knowledge
each
theme
is
identified
above
by
separate
tondo
containing
majestic
female
figure
seated
in
clouds
with
putti
bearing
phrases
seek
knowledge
of
causes
divine
inspiration
knowledge
of
things
divine
disputa
to
each
what
is
due
accordingly
figures
on
walls
below
exemplify
philosophy
poetry
including
music
theology
and
law
the
traditional
title
is
not
raphaels
the
subject
of
painting
is
actually
philosophy
or
at
least
ancient
greek
philosophy
and
its
overhead
tondolabel
causarum
cognitio
tells
us
what
kind
as
it
appears
to
echo
aristotles
emphasis
on
wisdom
as
knowing
why
hence
knowing
causes
in
metaphysics
book
i
and
physics
book
ii
indeed
plato
and
aristotle
appear
to
be
central
figures
in
scene
however
many
of
philosophers
depicted
sought
knowledge
of
first
causes
many
lived
before
plato
and
aristotle
and
hardly
third
were
athenians
the
architecture
contains
roman
elements
but
general
semicircular
setting
having
plato
and
aristotle
at
its
centre
might
be
alluding
to
pythagoras
monad
bramante
as
euclid
zoroaster
ptolemy
raphael
as
apelles
and
perugino
il
sodoma
or
timoteo
viti
as
protogenes
commentators
have
suggested
that
nearly
every
great
ancient
greek
philosopher
can
be
found
in
painting
but
determining
which
are
depicted
is
speculative
since
raphael
made
no
designations
outside
possible
likenesses
and
no
contemporary
documents
explain
painting
compounding
problem
raphael
had
to
invent
system
of
iconography
to
allude
to
various
figures
for
whom
there
were
no
traditional
visual
types
for
example
while
socrates
figure
is
immediately
recognizable
from
classical
busts
one
of
figures
alleged
to
be
epicurus
is
far
removed
from
his
standard
depiction
aspects
of
fresco
other
than
identities
of
figures
have
also
been
variously
interpreted
but
few
such
interpretations
are
unanimously
accepted
among
scholars
that
rhetorical
gestures
of
plato
and
aristotle
are
kinds
of
pointing
to
heavens
and
down
to
earth
is
popularly
accepted
as
likely
however
platos
timaeus
which
is
book
raphael
places
in
his
hand
was
sophisticated
treatment
of
space
time
and
change
including
earth
which
guided
mathematical
sciences
for
over
millennium
aristotle
with
his
fourelements
theory
held
that
all
change
on
earth
was
owing
to
motions
of
heavens
in
painting
aristotle
carries
his
ethics
which
he
denied
could
be
reduced
to
mathematical
science
it
is
not
certain
how
much
young
raphael
knew
of
ancient
philosophy
what
guidance
he
might
have
had
from
people
such
as
bramante
and
whether
detailed
program
was
dictated
by
his
sponsor
pope
julius
ii
nevertheless
fresco
has
even
recently
been
interpreted
as
exhortation
to
philosophy
and
in
deeper
way
as
visual
representation
of
role
of
love
in
elevating
people
toward
upper
knowledge
largely
in
consonance
with
contemporary
theories
of
marsilio
ficino
and
other
neoplatonic
thinkers
linked
to
raphael
finally
according
to
giorgio
vasari
scene
includes
raphael
himself
duke
of
mantua
zoroaster
and
some
evangelists
however
to
heinrich
wlfflin
it
is
quite
wrong
to
attempt
interpretations
of
school
of
athens
as
esoteric
treatise
the
allimportant
thing
was
artistic
motive
which
expressed
physical
or
spiritual
state
and
name
of
person
was
matter
of
indifference
in
raphaels
time
raphaels
artistry
then
orchestrates
beautiful
space
continuous
with
that
of
viewers
in
stanza
in
which
great
variety
of
human
figures
each
one
expressing
mental
states
by
physical
actions
interact
in
polyphony
unlike
anything
in
earlier
art
in
ongoing
dialogue
of
philosophy
an
interpretation
of
fresco
relating
to
hidden
symmetries
of
figures
and
star
constructed
by
bramante
was
given
by
guerino
mazzola
and
collaborators
the
main
basis
are
two
mirrored
triangles
on
drawing
from
bramante
euclid
which
correspond
to
feet
positions
of
certain
figures
figuresedit
the
identities
of
some
of
philosophers
in
picture
such
as
plato
and
aristotle
are
certain
beyond
that
identifications
of
raphaels
figures
have
always
been
hypothetical
to
complicate
matters
beginning
from
vasaris
efforts
some
have
received
multiple
identifications
not
only
as
ancients
but
also
as
figures
contemporary
with
raphael
vasari
mentions
portraits
of
young
federico
ii
gonzaga
duke
of
mantua
leaning
over
bramante
with
his
hands
raised
near
bottom
right
and
raphael
himself
central
figures
and
edit
an
elder
plato
walks
alongside
younger
aristotle
in
center
of
fresco
at
its
architectures
central
vanishing
point
are
two
undisputed
main
subjects
plato
on
left
and
aristotle
his
student
on
right
both
figures
hold
modern
of
time
bound
copies
of
their
books
in
their
left
hands
while
gesturing
with
their
right
plato
holds
timaeus
and
aristotle
holds
his
nicomachean
ethics
plato
is
depicted
as
old
grey
and
barefoot
by
contrast
aristotle
slightly
ahead
of
him
is
in
mature
manhood
wearing
sandals
and
goldtrimmed
robes
and
youth
about
them
seem
to
look
his
way
in
addition
these
two
central
figures
gesture
along
different
dimensions
plato
vertically
upward
along
pictureplane
into
vault
above
aristotle
on
horizontal
plane
at
rightangles
to
pictureplane
hence
in
strong
foreshortening
initiating
flow
of
space
toward
viewers
it
is
popularly
thought
that
their
gestures
indicate
central
aspects
of
their
philosophies
for
plato
his
theory
of
forms
and
for
aristotle
emphasis
on
concrete
particulars
many
interpret
painting
to
show
divergence
of
two
philosophical
schools
plato
argues
sense
of
timelessness
whilst
aristotle
looks
into
physicality
of
life
and
present
realm
settingedit
detail
of
architecture
the
building
is
in
shape
of
greek
cross
which
some
have
suggested
was
intended
to
show
harmony
between
pagan
philosophy
and
christian
theology
see
christianity
and
paganism
and
christian
philosophy
the
architecture
of
building
was
inspired
by
work
of
bramante
who
according
to
vasari
helped
raphael
with
architecture
in
picture
the
resulting
architecture
was
similar
to
then
new
st

are
two
sculptures

the
one

it
was

between

as
part
of

commission
to
decorate
rooms
now
known
as
stanze
di

in
apostolic

the

the
stanza

was
first

the

was
probably
third

finished
there
after

the

the
school
of
athens
is
one
of
group
of
four
main
frescoes
on
walls
of
stanza
those
on
either
side
centrally
interrupted
by
windows
that
depict
distinct
branches
of
knowledge
each
theme
is
identified

female
figure

in

with
putti

figures
on

below
exemplify
philosophy
poetry
including
music
theology
and
law
the
traditional
title
is
not
raphaels
the
subject
of
painting
is
actually
philosophy
or
at
least
ancient
greek
philosophy
and
its
overhead
tondolabel
causarum
cognitio
tells
us
what
kind
as
it
appears
to
echo
aristotles
emphasis
on
wisdom
as
knowing
why
hence
knowing
causes
in
metaphysics
book
i
and
physics
book
ii
indeed
plato
and
aristotle
appear
to
be
central
figures
in
scene
however
many
of
philosophers
depicted
sought
knowledge
of
first
causes
many
lived
before
plato
and
aristotle
and
hardly
third
were
athenians
the
architecture
contains
roman
elements
but
general
semicircular
setting
having
plato
and
aristotle
at
its
centre
might
be
alluding
to
pythagoras
monad
bramante
as
euclid
zoroaster
ptolemy
raphael
as
apelles
and
perugino
il
sodoma
or
timoteo
viti
as
protogenes
commentators
have
suggested
that
nearly
every
great
ancient
greek
philosopher
can
be
found
in
painting
but
determining
which
are
depicted
is
speculative
since
raphael
made
no
designations
outside
possible
likenesses
and
no
contemporary
documents
explain
painting
compounding
problem
raphael
had
to
invent
system
of
iconography
to
allude
to
various
figures
for
whom
there
were
no
traditional
visual
types
for
example
while
socrates
figure
is
immediately
recognizable
from
classical
busts
one
of
figures
alleged
to
be
epicurus
is
far
removed
from
his
standard
depiction
aspects
of
fresco
other
than
identities
of
figures
have
also
been
variously
interpreted
but
few
such
interpretations
are
unanimously
accepted
among
scholars
that
rhetorical
gestures
of
plato
and
aristotle
are
kinds
of
pointing
to
heavens
and
down
to
earth
is
popularly
accepted
as
likely
however
platos
timaeus
which
is
book
raphael
places
in
his
hand
was
sophisticated
treatment
of
space
time
and
change
including
earth
which
guided
mathematical
sciences
for
over
millennium
aristotle
with
his
fourelements
theory
held
that
all
change
on
earth
was
owing
to
motions
of
heavens
in
painting
aristotle
carries
his
ethics
which
he
denied
could
be
reduced
to
mathematical
science
it
is
not
certain
how
much
young
raphael
knew
of
ancient
philosophy
what
guidance
he
might
have
had
from
people
such
as
bramante
and
whether
detailed
program
was
dictated
by
his
sponsor
pope
julius
ii
nevertheless
fresco
has
even
recently
been
interpreted
as
exhortation
to
philosophy
and
in
deeper
way
as
visual
representation
of
role
of
love
in
elevating
people
toward
upper
knowledge
largely
in
consonance
with
contemporary
theories
of
marsilio
ficino
and
other
neoplatonic
thinkers
linked
to
raphael
finally
according
to
giorgio
vasari
scene
includes
raphael
himself
duke
of
mantua
zoroaster
and
some
evangelists
however
to
heinrich
wlfflin
it
is
quite
wrong
to
attempt
interpretations
of
school
of
athens
as
esoteric
treatise
the
allimportant
thing
was
artistic
motive
which
expressed
physical
or
spiritual
state
and
name
of
person
was
matter
of
indifference
in
raphaels
time
raphaels
artistry
then
orchestrates
beautiful
space
continuous
with
that
of
viewers
in
stanza
in
which
great
variety
of
human
figures
each
one
expressing
mental
states
by
physical
actions
interact
in
polyphony
unlike
anything
in
earlier
art
in
ongoing
dialogue
of
philosophy
an
interpretation
of
fresco
relating
to
hidden
symmetries
of
figures
and
star
constructed
by
bramante
was
given
by
guerino
mazzola
and
collaborators
the
main
basis
are

the
identities
of
some
of
philosophers
in
picture
such
as
plato
and
aristotle
are
certain
beyond
that
identifications
of
raphaels
figures
have
always
been
hypothetical
to
complicate
matters
beginning
from
vasaris
efforts
some
have
received
multiple
identifications
not
only
as
ancients
but
also
as
figures

at
its

central
vanishing
point
are
two
undisputed
main
subjects
plato
on
left
and
aristotle
his
student
on
right
both
figures
hold
modern
of
time
bound
copies
of
their
books
in
their
left
hands
while
gesturing
with
their
right
plato
holds
timaeus
and
aristotle
holds
his
nicomachean
ethics
plato
is
depicted
as
old
grey
and
barefoot
by
contrast
aristotle
slightly
ahead
of
him
is
in
mature
manhood
wearing
sandals
and
goldtrimmed
robes
and
youth
about
them
seem
to
look
his
way
in
addition
these
two
central
figures
gesture
along
different
dimensions
plato
vertically
upward
along
pictureplane
into
vault
above
aristotle
on
horizontal
plane
at
rightangles
to
pictureplane
hence
in
strong
foreshortening
initiating
flow
of
space
toward
viewers
it
is
popularly
thought
that
their
gestures
indicate
central
aspects
of
their
philosophies
for
plato
his
theory
of
forms
and
for
aristotle
emphasis
on
concrete
particulars
many
interpret
painting
to
show
divergence
of
two
philosophical
schools
plato
argues
sense
of
timelessness
whilst
aristotle
looks
into
physicality
of
life
and
present
realm
settingedit
detail
of
architecture
the
building
is
in
shape
of

cross

some
have
suggested
was
intended
to
show
harmony
between
pagan
philosophy
and
christian
theology
see
christianity
and
paganism
and
christian
philosophy
the
architecture
of
building
was
inspired
by
work
of
bramante
who
according
to
vasari
helped
raphael
with
architecture
in
picture
the
resulting
architecture
was
similar
to
then

april
known

raphael
was
italian
painter

architect
of

his
work
is
admired
for
its
clarity
of
form
ease
of
composition
and
visual
achievement
of
neoplatonic
ideal
of
human
grandeur
together
with
michelangelo
and
leonardo
da
vinci
he
forms
traditional
trinity
of
great
masters
of
that
period
raphael
was
enormously
productive
running
unusually
large
workshop
and
despite
his
early
death
at
leaving
large
body
of
work
many
of
his
works
are
found
in
vatican
palace
where
frescoed
raphael
rooms
were
central
and
largest
work
of
his
career
the
best
known
work
is
the
school
of
athens
in
vatican
stanza
della
segnatura
after
his
early
years
in
rome
much
of
his
work
was
executed
by
his
workshop
from
his
drawings
with
considerable
loss
of
quality
he
was
extremely
influential
in
his
lifetime
though
outside
rome
his
work
was
mostly
known
from
his
collaborative
printmaking
raphael
the
school
of
athens
after
his
death
influence
of
his
great
rival
michelangelo
was
more
widespread
until
th
and
th
centuries
when
raphaels
more
serene
and
harmonious
qualities
were
again
regarded
as
highest
models
his
career
falls
naturally
into
three
phases
and
three
styles
first
described
by
giorgio
vasari
his
early
years
in
umbria
then
period
of
about
four
years
absorbing
artistic
traditions
of
florence
followed
by
his
last
hectic
and
triumphant
twelve
years
in
rome
working
for
two
popes
and
their
close
associates
his
father
was
court
painter
to
ruler
of
small
but
highly
cultured
city
of
urbino
he
died
when
raphael
was
eleven
and
raphael
seems
to
have
played
role
in
managing
family
workshop
from
this
point
he
trained
in
workshop
of
perugino
and
was
described
as
fully
trained
master
by
he
worked
in
or
for
several
cities
in
north
italy
until
in
he
moved
to
rome
at
invitation
of
pope
to
work
on
vatican
palace
he
was
given
series
of
important
commissions
there
and
elsewhere
in
city
and
began
to
work
as
architect

background
giovanni
santi
raphaels
father
christ
supported
by
two
angels
c
raphael
was
born
in
small
but
artistically
significant
central
italian
city
of
urbino
in
marche
region
where
his
father
giovanni
santi
was
court
painter
to
duke
the
reputation
of
court
had
been
established
by
federico
da
montefeltro
highly
successful
condottiere
who
had
been
created
duke
of
urbino
by
pope
sixtus
iv
urbino
formed
part
of
papal
states
and
who
died
year
before
raphael
was
born
the
emphasis
of
federicos
court
was
more
literary
than
artistic
but
giovanni
santi
was
poet
of
sorts
as
well
as
painter
and
had
written
rhymed
chronicle
of
life
of
federico
and
both
wrote
texts
and
produced
decor
for
masquelike
court
entertainments
his
poem
to
federico
shows
him
as
keen
to
demonstrate
awareness
of
most
advanced
north
italian
painters
and
early
netherlandish
artists
as
well
in
very
small
court
of
urbino
he
was
probably
more
integrated
into
central
circle
of
ruling
family
than
most
court
painters
federico
was
succeeded
by
his
son
guidobaldo
da
montefeltro
who
married
elisabetta
gonzaga
daughter
of
ruler
of
mantua
most
brilliant
of
smaller
italian
courts
for
both
music
and
visual
arts
under
them
court
continued
as
centre
for
literary
culture
growing
up
in
circle
of
this
small
court
gave
raphael
excellent
manners
and
social
skills
stressed
by
vasari
court
life
in
urbino
at
just
after
this
period
was
to
become
set
as
model
of
virtues
of
italian
humanist
court
through
baldassare
castigliones
depiction
of
it
in
his
classic
work
the
book
of
courtier
published
in
castiglione
moved
to
urbino
in
when
raphael
was
no
longer
based
there
but
frequently
visited
and
they
became
good
friends
raphael
became
close
to
other
regular
visitors
to
court
pietro
bibbiena
and
pietro
bembo
both
later
cardinals
were
already
becoming
well
known
as
writers
and
would
later
be
in
rome
during
raphaels
period
there
raphael
mixed
easily
in
highest
circles
throughout
his
life
one
of
factors
that
tended
to
give
misleading
impression
of
effortlessness
to
his
career
he
did
not
receive
full
humanistic
education
however
it
is
unclear
how
easily
he
read
latin
early
life
and
work

uffizi
gallery
raphaels
mother
mgia
died
in
when
he
was
eight
followed
on
august
by
his
father
who
had
already
remarried
raphael
was
thus
orphaned
at
eleven
his
formal
guardian
became
his
only
paternal
uncle
bartolomeo
priest
who
subsequently
engaged
in
litigation
with
his
stepmother
he
probably
continued
to
live
with
his
stepmother
when
not
staying
as
apprentice
with
master
he
had
already
shown
talent
according
to
vasari
who
says
that
raphael
had
been
great
help
to
his
father
a
selfportrait
drawing
from
his
teenage
years
shows
his
precocity
his
fathers
workshop
continued
and
probably
together
with
his
stepmother
raphael
evidently
played
part
in
managing
it
from
very
early
age
in
urbino
he
came
into
contact
with
works
of
paolo
uccello
previously
court
painter
d
and
luca
signorelli
who
until
was
based
in
nearby
citt
di
castello
according
to
vasari
his
father
placed
him
in
workshop
of
umbrian
master
pietro
perugino
as
apprentice
despite
tears
of
his
motherb
the
evidence
of
apprenticeship
comes
only
from
vasari
and
another
source
and
has
been
disputed
eight
was
very
early
for
apprenticeship
to
begin
an
alternative
theory
is
that
he
received
at
least
some
training
from
timoteo
viti
who
acted
as
court
painter
in
urbino
from
most
modern
historians
agree
that
raphael
at
least
worked
as
assistant
to
perugino
from
around
influence
of
perugino
on
raphaels
early
work
is
very
clear
probably
no
other
pupil
of
genius
has
ever
absorbed
so
much
of
his
masters
teaching
as
raphael
did
according
to
wlfflin
vasari
wrote
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
between
their
hands
at
this
period
but
many
modern
art
historians
claim
to
do
better
and
detect
his
hand
in
specific
areas
of
works
by
perugino
or
his
workshop
apart
from
stylistic
closeness
their
techniques
are
very
similar
as
well
for
example
having
paint
applied
thickly
using
oil
varnish
medium
in
shadows
and
darker
garments
but
very
thinly
on
flesh
areas
an
excess
of
resin
in
varnish
often
causes
cracking
of
areas
of
paint
in
works
of
both
masters
the
perugino
workshop
was
active
in
both
perugia
and
florence
perhaps
maintaining
two
permanent
branches
raphael
is
described
as
master
that
is
to
say
fully
trained
in
december
his
first
documented
work
was
baronci
altarpiece
for
church
of
saint
nicholas
of
tolentino
in
citt
di
castello
town
halfway
between
perugia
and
urbino
evangelista
da
pian
di
meleto
who
had
worked
for
his
father
was
also
named
in
commission
it
was
commissioned
in
and
finished
in
now
only
some
cut
sections
and
preparatory
drawing
remain
in
following
years
he
painted
works
for
other
churches
there
including
mond
crucifixion
about
and
brera
wedding
of
virgin
and
for
perugia
such
as
oddi
altarpiece
he
very
probably
also
visited
florence
in
this
period
these
are
large
works
some
in
fresco
where
raphael
confidently
marshals
his
compositions
in
somewhat
static
style
of
perugino
he
also
painted
many
small
and
exquisite
cabinet
paintings
in
these
years
probably
mostly
for
connoisseurs
in
urbino
court
like
three
graces
and
st
michael
and
he
began
to
paint
madonnas
and
portraits
in
he
went
to
siena
at
invitation
of
another
pupil
of
perugino
pinturicchio
being
friend
of
raphael
and
knowing
him
to
be
draughtsman
of
highest
quality
to
help
with
cartoons
and
very
likely
designs
for
fresco
series
in
piccolomini
library
in
siena
cathedral
he
was
evidently
already
much
in
demand
even
at
this
early
stage
in
his
career
the
mond
crucifixion
very
much
in
style
of
perugino

raphael
led
nomadic
life
working
in
various
centres
in
northern
italy
but
spent
good
deal
of
time
in
florence
perhaps
from
about
although
there
is
traditional
reference
to
florentine
period
of
about
he
was
possibly
never
continuous
resident
there
he
may
have
needed
to
visit
city
to
secure
materials
in
any
case
there
is
letter
of
recommendation
of
raphael
dated
october
from
mother
of
next
duke
of
urbino
to
gonfaloniere
of
florence
the
bearer
of
this
will
be
found
to
be
raphael
painter
of
urbino
who
being
greatly
gifted
in
his
profession
has
determined
to
spend
some
time
in
florence
to
study
and
because
his
father
was
most
worthy
and
i
was
very
attached
to
him
and
son
is
sensible
and
wellmannered
young
man
on
both
accounts
i
bear
him
great
love
as
earlier
with
perugino
and
others
raphael
was
able
to
assimilate
influence
of
florentine
art
whilst
keeping
his
own
developing
style
frescos
in
perugia
of
about
show
new
monumental
quality
in
figures
which
may
represent
influence
of
fra
bartolomeo
who
vasari
says
was
friend
of
raphael
but
most
striking
influence
in
work
of
these
years
is
leonardo
da
vinci
who
returned
to
city
from
to
raphaels
figures
begin
to
take
more
dynamic
and
complex
positions
and
though
as
yet
his
painted
subjects
are
still
mostly
tranquil
he
made
drawn
studies
of
fighting
nude
men
one
of
obsessions
of
period
in
florence
another
drawing
is
portrait
of
young
woman
that
uses
threequarter
length
pyramidal
composition
of
justcompleted
mona
lisa
but
still
looks
completely
raphaelesque
another
of
leonardos
compositional
inventions
pyramidal
holy
family
was
repeated
in
series
of
works
that
remain
among
his
most
famous
easel
paintings
there
is
drawing
by
raphael
in
royal
collection
of
leonardos
lost
leda
and
swan
from
which
he
adapted
contrapposto
pose
of
his
own
saint
catherine
of
alexandria
he
also
perfects
his
own
version
of
leonardos
sfumato
modelling
to
give
subtlety
to
his
painting
of
flesh
and
develops
interplay
of
glances
between
his
groups
which
are
much
less
enigmatic
than
those
of
leonardo
but
he
keeps
soft
clear
light
of
perugino
in
his
paintings
leonardo
was
more
than
thirty
years
older
than
raphael
but
michelangelo
who
was
in
rome
for
this
period
was
just
eight
years
his
senior
michelangelo
already
disliked
leonardo
and
in
rome
came
to
dislike
raphael
even
more
attributing
conspiracies
against
him
to
younger
man
raphael
would
have
been
aware
of
his
works
in
florence
but
in
his
most
original
work
of
these
years
he
strikes
out
in
different
direction
his
deposition
of
christ
draws
on
classical
sarcophagi
to
spread
figures
across
front
of
picture
space
in
complex
and
not
wholly
successful
arrangement
wllflin
detects
in
kneeling
figure
on
right
influence
of
madonna
in
michelangelos
doni
tondo
but
rest
of
composition
is
far
removed
from
his
style
or
that
of
leonardo
though
highly
regarded
at
time
and
much
later
forcibly
removed
from
perugia
by
borghese
it
stands
rather
alone
in
raphaels
work
his
classicism
would
later
take
less
literal
direction
the
ansidei
madonna
c
beginning
to
move
on
from
perugino
the
madonna
of
meadow
c
using
leonardos
pyramidal
composition
for
subjects
of
holy
family
saint
catherine
of
alexandria
possibly
echoes
pose
of
leonardos
leda
deposition
of
christ
drawing
from
roman
sarcophagi
roman
period
vatican
stanze
in
raphael
moved
to
rome
where
he
resided
for
rest
of
his
life
he
was
invited
by
new
pope
julius
ii
perhaps
at
suggestion
of
his
architect
donato
bramante
then
engaged
on
st
peters
basilica
who
came
from
just
outside
urbino
and
was
distantly
related
to
raphael
unlike
michelangelo
who
had
been
kept
lingering
in
rome
for
several
months
after
his
first
summons
raphael
was
immediately
commissioned
by
julius
to
fresco
what
was
intended
to
become
popes
private
library
at
vatican
palace
this
was
much
larger
and
more
important
commission
than
any
he
had
received
before
he
had
only
painted
one
altarpiece
in
florence
itself
several
other
artists
and
their
teams
of
assistants
were
already
at
work
on
different
rooms
many
painting
over
recently
completed
paintings
commissioned
by
juliuss
loathed
predecessor
alexander
vi
whose
contributions
and
arms
julius
was
determined
to
efface
from
palace
michelangelo
meanwhile
had
been
commissioned
to
paint
sistine
chapel
ceiling
the
parnassus
stanza
della
segnatura
this
first
of
famous
stanze
or
raphael
rooms
to
be
painted
now
known
as
stanza
della
segnatura
after
its
use
in
vasaris
time
was
to
make
stunning
impact
on
roman
art
and
remains
generally
regarded
as
his
greatest
masterpiece
containing
the
school
of
athens
the
parnassus
and
disputa
raphael
was
then
given
further
rooms
to
paint
displacing
other
artists
including
perugino
and
signorelli
he
completed
sequence
of
three
rooms
each
with
paintings
on
each
wall
and
often
ceilings
too
increasingly
leaving
work
of
painting
from
his
detailed
drawings
to
large
and
skilled
workshop
team
he
had
acquired
who
added
fourth
room
probably
only
including
some
elements
designed
by
raphael
after
his
early
death
in
the
death
of
julius
in
did
not
interrupt
work
at
all
as
he
was
succeeded
by
raphaels
last
pope
medici
pope
leo
x
with
whom
raphael
formed
even
closer
relationship
and
who
continued
to
commission
him
raphaels
friend
cardinal
bibbiena
was
also
one
of
leos
old
tutors
and
close
friend
and
advisor
raphael
was
clearly
influenced
by
michelangelos
sistine
chapel
ceiling
in
course
of
painting
room
vasari
said
bramante
let
him
in
secretly
the
first
section
was
completed
in
and
reaction
of
other
artists
to
daunting
force
of
michelangelo
was
dominating
question
in
italian
art
for
following
few
decades
raphael
who
had
already
shown
his
gift
for
absorbing
influences
into
his
own
personal
style
rose
to
challenge
perhaps
better
than
any
other
artist
one
of
first
and
clearest
instances
was
portrait
in
the
school
of
athens
of
michelangelo
himself
as
heraclitus
which
seems
to
draw
clearly
from
sybils
and
ignudi
of
sistine
ceiling
other
figures
in
that
and
later
paintings
in
room
show
same
influences
but
as
still
cohesive
with
development
of
raphaels
own
style
michelangelo
accused
raphael
of
plagiarism
and
years
after
raphaels
death
complained
in
letter
that
everything
he
knew
about
art
he
got
from
me
although
other
quotations
show
more
generous
reactions
these
very
large
and
complex
compositions
have
been
regarded
ever
since
as
among
supreme
works
of
grand
manner
of
high
renaissance
and
classic
art
of
postantique
west
they
give
highly
idealised
depiction
of
forms
represented
and
compositions
though
very
carefully
conceived
in
drawings
achieve
sprezzatura
term
invented
by
his
friend
castiglione
who
defined
it
as
certain
nonchalance
which
conceals
all
artistry
and
makes
whatever
one
says
or
does
seem
uncontrived
and
effortless
according
to
michael
levey
raphael
gives
his
figures
superhuman
clarity
and
grace
in
universe
of
euclidian
certainties
the
painting
is
nearly
all
of
highest
quality
in
first
two
rooms
but
later
compositions
in
stanze
especially
those
involving
dramatic
action
are
not
entirely
as
successful

in
conception
or
their
execution

was
altered

demolished
after
his
death

acceptance
of

few

it
appears
his
designs
would
have
made

gloomier
than

down

according
to
critical
posthumous

by

it

perhaps
have
resembled

in

of
the
expulsion
of

from

he
designed
several
other
buildings
and
for
short
time
was
most
important
architect
in

working
for
small
circle
around
papacy
julius
had
made
changes
to
street

creating

he
wanted

it

was
required
to

days
and

without
permission
raphael
wrote
letter
to

suggesting
ways
of
halting
destruction
of
ancient
monuments
and
proposed
visual
survey
of

michiel
raphaels
youthful

saddened
men
of

because
he
was
not
able

which
was

workshop
vasari
says
that
raphael
eventually
had
workshop
of
fifty
pupils
and
assistants
many
of
whom
later
became
significant
artists
in
their
own
right
this
was
arguably
largest
workshop
team
assembled
under
any
single
old
master
painter
and
much
higher
than
norm
they
included
established
masters
from
other
parts
of
italy
probably
working
with
their
own
teams
as
subcontractors
as
well
as
pupils
and
journeymen
we
have
very
little
evidence
of
internal
working
arrangements
of
workshop
apart
from
works
of
art
themselves
which
are
often
very
difficult
to
assign
to
particular
hand
the
most
important
figures
were
giulio
romano
young
pupil
from
rome
only
about
twentyone
at
raphaels
death
and
gianfrancesco
penni
already
florentine
master
they
were
left
many
of
raphaels
drawings
and
other
possessions
and
to
some
extent
continued
workshop
after
raphaels
death
penni
did
not
achieve
personal
reputation
equal
to
giulios
as
after
raphaels
death
he
became
giulios
lessthanequal

in
turn
for
much
of
his
subsequent
career
perino

master
and
polidoro

was
supposedly
promoted
from

also
became
notable

in
their

polidoros

like
penni
been
overshadowed

reputation

his
partner
giovanni
da
udine
had
more
independent
status
and
was
responsible
for
decorative
stucco
work
and
grotesques
surrounding
main
frescoes
most
of
artists
were
later
scattered
and
some
killed
by
violent
sack
of
rome
in
this
did
however
contribute
to
diffusion
of
versions
of
raphaels
style
around
italy
and
beyond
vasari
emphasises
that
raphael
ran
very
harmonious
and
efficient
workshop
and
had
extraordinary
skill
in
smoothing
over
troubles
and
arguments
with
both
patrons
and
his
assistants
contrast
with
stormy
pattern
of
michelangelos
relationships
with
both
however
though
both
penni
and
giulio
were
sufficiently
skilled
that
distinguishing
between
their
hands
and
that
of
raphael
himself
is
still
sometimes
difficult
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
of
raphaels
later
wallpaintings
and
probably
some
of
his
easel
paintings
are
more
notable
for
their
design
than
their
execution
many
of
his
portraits
if
in
good
condition
show
his
brilliance
in
detailed
handling
of

raphael
was
one
of
finest
draftsmen
in
history
of
western
art
and
used
drawings
extensively
to
plan
his
compositions
according
to
nearcontemporary
when
beginning
to
plan
composition
he
would
lay
out
large
number
of
stock
drawings
of
his
on
floor
and
begin
to
draw
rapidly
borrowing
figures
from
here
and
there
over
forty
sketches
survive
for
disputa
in
stanze
and
there
may
well
have
been
many
more
originally
over
four
hundred
sheets
survive
altogether
he
used
different
drawings
to
refine
his
poses
and
compositions
apparently
to
greater
extent
than
most
other
painters
to
judge
by
number
of
variants
that
survive
this
is
how
raphael
himself
who
was
so
rich
in
inventiveness
used
to
work
always
coming
up
with
four
or
six
ways
to
show
narrative
each
one
different
from
rest
and
all
of
them
full
of
grace
and
well
done

raphael
made
no
prints
himself
but
entered
into
collaboration
with
marcantonio
raimondi
to
produce
engravings
to
raphaels
designs
which
created
many
of
most
famous
italian
prints
of
century
and
was
important
in
rise
of
reproductive
print
his
interest
was
unusual
in
such
major
artist
from
his
contemporaries
it
was
only
shared
by
titian
who
had
worked
much
less
successfully
with
raimondi
a
total
of
about
fifty
prints
were
made
some
were
copies
of
raphaels
paintings
but
other
designs
were
apparently
created
by
raphael
purely
to
be
turned
into
prints
raphael
made
preparatory
drawings
many
of
which
survive
for
raimondi
to
translate
into
engraving
the
most
famous
original
prints
to
result
from
collaboration
were

the

which
two
virtually
identical
versions
were
engraved

considerable
differences

also

raphael
was
highly
admired
by
his
contemporaries
although
his
influence
on
artistic
style
in
his
own
century
was
less
than
that
of
michelangelo
mannerism
beginning
at
time
of
his
death
and
later
baroque
took
art
in
direction
totally
opposed
to
raphaels
qualities
with

death

art
high
renaissance
subsided
as
walter
friedlnder
put
it
he
was
soon
seen
as
ideal
model
by
those
disliking
excesses
of
mannerism
opinion
was
generally
held
in
middle
of
sixteenth
century
that
raphael
was
ideal
balanced
painter
universal
in
his
talent
satisfying
all
absolute
standards
and
obeying
all
rules
which
were
supposed
to
govern
arts
whereas
michelangelo
was
eccentric
genius
more
brilliant
than
any
other
artists
in
his
particular
field
drawing
of
male
nude
but
unbalanced
and
lacking
in
certain
qualities
such
as
grace
and
restraint
essential
to
great
artist
those
like
dolce
and
aretino
who
held
this
view
were
usually
survivors
of
renaissance
humanism
unable
to
follow
michelangelo
as
he
moved
on
into
mannerism
vasari
himself
despite
his
hero
remaining
michelangelo
came
to
see
his
influence
as
harmful
in
some
ways
and
added
passages
to

raphaels
compositions
were
always
admired
and
studied
and
became
cornerstone
of
training
of
academies
of
art
his
period
of
greatest
influence
was
from
late
th
to
late
th
centuries
when
his
perfect
decorum
and
balance
were
greatly
admired
he
was
seen
as
best
model
for
history
painting
regarded
as
highest
in
hierarchy
of
genres
sir
joshua
reynolds
in
his
discourses
praised
his
simple
grave
and
majestic
dignity
and
said
he
stands
in
general
foremost
of
first
ie
best
painters
especially
for
his
frescoes
in
which
he
included
raphael
cartoons
whereas
michael
angelo
claims
next
attention
he
did
not
possess
so
many
excellences
as
raffaelle
but
those
he
had
were
of
highest
kind
echoing
sixteenthcentury
views
above
reynolds
goes
on
to
say
of
raphael
the
excellency
of
this
extraordinary
man
lay
in
propriety
beauty
and
majesty
of
his
characters
his
judicious
contrivance
of
his
composition
correctness
of
drawing
purity
of
taste
and
skilful
accommodation
of
other
mens
conceptions
to
his
own
purpose
nobody
excelled
him
in
that
judgment
with
which
he
united
to
his
own
observations
on
nature
energy
of
michael
angelo
and
beauty
and
simplicity
of
antique
to
question
therefore
which
ought
to
hold
first
rank
raffaelle
or
michael
angelo
it
must
be
answered
that
if
it
is
to
be
given
to
him
who
possessed
greater
combination
of
higher
qualities
of
art
than
any
other
man
there
is
no
doubt
but
raffaelle
is
first
but
if
according
to
longinus
sublime
being
highest
excellence
that
human
composition
can
attain
to
abundantly
compensates
absence
of
every
other
beauty
and
atones
for
all
other
deficiencies
then
michael
angelo
demands
preference
reynolds
was
less
enthusiastic
about
raphaels
panel
paintings
but
slight
sentimentality
of
these
made
them
enormously
popular
in
th
century
we
have
been
familiar
with
them
from
childhood
onwards
through
far
greater
mass
of
reproductions
than
any
other

in

has
ever
had

brotherhood
explicitly
reacted
against
his
influence
and
that
of
his
admirers
such
as
joshua
reynolds
seeking
to
return
to
styles
that
predated
what
they
saw
as
his
baneful
influence
according
to
critic
whose
ideas
greatly
influenced
them
john
ruskin
the
doom
of
arts
of
europe
went
forth
from
that
chamber
stanza
della
segnatura
and
it
was
brought
about
in
great
part
by
very
excellencies
of
man
who
had
thus
marked
commencement
of
decline
the
perfection
of
execution
and
beauty
of
feature
which
were
attained
in
his
works
and
in
those
of
his
great
contemporaries
rendered
finish
of
execution
and
beauty
of
form
chief
objects
of
all
artists
and
thenceforward
execution
was
looked
for
rather
than
thought
and
beauty
rather
than
veracity
and
as
i
told
you
these
are
two
secondary
causes
of

both
perugino
and
leonardo
da
vinci
were
present
and
seems
to
have
viewed
them
as
being
at
equivalent
skill
level
after
leonardo
left
for
milan
santi
chose
perugino
from

of

available
artists

raphaels
age
at
death
is
debated
by
some
with
michiel
asserting
that
raphael
died
at
while
pandolfo
pico
and
girolamo
lippomano
arguing
that
he
died
at
whereas
michiel
said
he
died
on
his
birthday
art
historian
john
shearman
addressed
this
apparent
discrepancy
the
time
of
death
can
be
calculated
from
convention
of
counting
from
sundown
which
michaelis
puts
at
on
friday
april
plus
halfhour
to
ave
maria
plus
three
hours
that
is
soon
after
pm
the
coincidence
noted
between
birthdate
and
deathdate
is
usually
thought
in
this
case
since
it
refers
to
friday
and
saturday
in
holy
week
movable
feast
rather
than
day
of
month
to
fortify
argument
that
raphael
was
also
born
on
good
friday
ie
march
but
there
is
notable
ambiguity
in
michiels
note
not
often
noticed
morse
venerdi
santo
venendo
il
sabato
giorno
della
sua
nativita
may
also
be
taken
to
mean
that
his
birthday
was
on
saturday
and
in
that
case
awareness
could
as
well
be
date
thus
producing
birthdate
of
april
bufarale
diagnosed
pneumonia
or
military
fever
while
portigliotti
suggested
pulmonary
disease
joannides
stated
that
raphael
died
of
overwork
cited
by
jeanmvincent
audin
although
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
journals
existence

citations
jones

p
the
portrait
of
raphael
is
probably
later
adaptation
of
one
likeness
which
all
agree
on
that
in
the
school
of
athens
vouched
for
by
vasari
variants
also
include
raffaello

raffaello
da
urbino
or
rafael
sanzio
da
urbino
the
surname
sanzio
derives
from
latinization
of

known

raphael
was
italian
painter

architect
of
high

his
work
is
admired
for
its
clarity
of
form
ease
of
composition
and
visual
achievement
of
neoplatonic
ideal
of
human
grandeur
together
with
michelangelo
and
leonardo
da
vinci
he
forms
traditional
trinity
of
great
masters
of
that
period
raphael
was
enormously
productive
running
unusually
large
workshop
and
despite
his
early
death
at
leaving
large
body
of
work
many
of
his
works
are
found
in
vatican
palace
where
frescoed
raphael
rooms
were
central
and
largest
work
of
his
career
the
best
known
work
is
the
school
of
athens
in
vatican
stanza
della
segnatura
after
his
early
years
in
rome
much
of
his
work
was
executed
by
his
workshop
from
his
drawings
with
considerable
loss
of
quality
he
was
extremely
influential
in
his
lifetime
though
outside
rome
his
work
was
mostly
known
from
his
collaborative
printmaking
raphael
the
school
of
athens
after
his
death
influence
of
his
great
rival
michelangelo
was
more
widespread
until
th
and
th
centuries
when
raphaels
more
serene
and
harmonious
qualities
were
again
regarded
as
highest
models
his
career
falls
naturally
into
three
phases
and
three
styles
first
described
by
giorgio
vasari
his
early
years
in
umbria
then
period
of
about
four
years
absorbing
artistic
traditions
of
florence
followed
by
his
last
hectic
and
triumphant
twelve
years
in
rome
working
for
two
popes
and
their
close
associates
his
father
was
court
painter
to
ruler
of
small
but
highly
cultured
city
of
urbino
he
died
when
raphael
was
eleven
and
raphael
seems
to
have
played
role
in
managing
family
workshop
from
this
point
he
trained
in
workshop
of
perugino
and
was
described
as
fully
trained
master
by
he
worked
in
or
for
several
cities
in
north
italy
until
in
he
moved
to
rome
at
invitation
of
pope
to
work
on
vatican
palace
he
was
given
series
of
important
commissions
there
and
elsewhere
in
city

background
giovanni
santi
raphaels
father
christ
supported
by
two
angels
c
raphael
was
born
in
small
but
artistically
significant
central
italian
city
of
urbino
in
marche
region
where
his
father
giovanni
santi
was
court
painter
to
duke
the
reputation
of
court
had
been
established
by
federico
da
montefeltro
highly
successful
condottiere
who
had
been
created
duke
of
urbino
by
pope
sixtus
iv
urbino
formed
part
of
papal
states
and
who
died
year
before
raphael
was
born
the
emphasis
of
federicos
court
was
more
literary
than
artistic
but
giovanni
santi
was
poet
of
sorts
as
well
as
painter
and
had
written
rhymed
chronicle
of
life
of
federico
and
both
wrote
texts
and
produced
decor
for
masquelike
court
entertainments
his
poem
to
federico
shows
him
as
keen
to
demonstrate
awareness
of
most
advanced
north
italian
painters
and
early
netherlandish
artists
as
well
in
very
small
court
of
urbino
he
was
probably
more
integrated
into
central
circle
of
ruling
family
than
most
court
painters
federico
was
succeeded
by
his
son
guidobaldo
da
montefeltro
who
married
elisabetta
gonzaga
daughter
of
ruler
of
mantua
most
brilliant
of
smaller
italian
courts
for
both
music
and
visual
arts
under
them
court
continued
as
centre
for
literary
culture
growing
up
in
circle
of
this
small
court
gave
raphael
excellent
manners
and
social
skills
stressed
by
vasari
court
life
in
urbino
at
just
after
this
period
was
to
become
set
as
model
of
virtues
of
italian
humanist
court
through
baldassare
castigliones
depiction
of
it
in
his
classic
work
the
book
of
courtier
published
in
castiglione
moved
to
urbino
in
when
raphael
was
no
longer
based
there
but
frequently
visited
and
they
became
good
friends
raphael
became
close
to
other
regular
visitors
to
court
pietro
bibbiena
and
pietro
bembo
both
later
cardinals
were
already
becoming
well
known
as
writers
and
would
later
be
in
rome
during
raphaels
period
there
raphael
mixed
easily
in
highest
circles
throughout
his
life
one
of
factors
that
tended
to
give
misleading
impression
of
effortlessness
to
his
career
he
did
not
receive
full
humanistic
education
however
it
is
unclear
how
easily
he

raphaels
mother
mgia
died
in
when
he
was
eight
followed
on
august
by
his
father
who
had
already
remarried
raphael
was
thus
orphaned
at
eleven
his
formal
guardian
became
his
only
paternal
uncle
bartolomeo
priest
who
subsequently
engaged
in
litigation
with
his
stepmother
he
probably
continued
to
live
with
his
stepmother
when
not
staying
as
apprentice
with
master
he
had
already
shown
talent
according
to
vasari
who
says
that
raphael
had
been
great
help
to
his
father
a
selfportrait
drawing
from
his
teenage
years
shows
his
precocity
his
fathers
workshop
continued
and
probably
together
with
his
stepmother
raphael
evidently
played
part
in
managing
it
from
very
early
age
in
urbino
he
came
into
contact
with
works
of
paolo
uccello
previously
court
painter
d
and
luca
signorelli
who
until
was
based
in
nearby
citt
di
castello
according
to
vasari
his
father
placed
him
in
workshop
of
umbrian
master
pietro
perugino
as
apprentice
despite
tears
of
his
motherb
the
evidence
of
apprenticeship
comes
only
from
vasari
and
another
source
and
has
been
disputed
eight
was
very
early
for
apprenticeship
to
begin
an
alternative
theory
is
that
he
received
at
least
some
training
from
timoteo
viti
who
acted
as
court
painter
in
urbino
from
most
modern
historians
agree
that
raphael
at
least
worked
as
assistant
to
perugino
from
around
influence
of
perugino
on
raphaels
early
work
is
very
clear
probably
no
other
pupil
of
genius
has
ever
absorbed
so
much
of
his
masters
teaching
as
raphael
did
according
to
wlfflin
vasari
wrote
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
between
their
hands
at
this
period
but
many
modern
art
historians
claim
to
do
better
and
detect
his
hand
in
specific
areas
of
works
by
perugino
or
his
workshop
apart
from
stylistic
closeness
their
techniques
are
very
similar
as
well
for
example
having
paint
applied
thickly
using
oil
varnish
medium
in
shadows
and
darker
garments
but
very
thinly
on
flesh
areas
an
excess
of
resin
in
varnish
often
causes
cracking
of
areas
of
paint
in
works
of
both
masters
the
perugino
workshop
was
active
in
both
perugia
and
florence
perhaps
maintaining
two
permanent
branches
raphael
is
described
as
master
that
is
to
say
fully
trained
in
december
his
first
documented
work
was
baronci
altarpiece
for
church
of
saint
nicholas
of
tolentino
in
citt
di
castello
town
halfway
between
perugia
and
urbino
evangelista
da
pian
di
meleto
who
had
worked
for
his
father
was
also
named
in
commission
it
was
commissioned
in
and
finished
in
now
only
some
cut
sections
and
preparatory
drawing
remain
in
following
years
he
painted
works
for
other
churches
there
including
mond
crucifixion
about
and
brera
wedding
of
virgin
and
for
perugia
such
as
oddi
altarpiece
he
very
probably
also
visited
florence
in
this
period
these
are
large
works
some
in
fresco
where
raphael
confidently
marshals
his
compositions
in
somewhat
static
style
of
perugino
he
also
painted
many
small
and
exquisite
cabinet
paintings
in
these
years
probably
mostly
for
connoisseurs
in
urbino
court
like
three
graces
and
st
michael
and
he
began
to
paint
madonnas
and
portraits
in
he
went
to
siena
at
invitation
of
another
pupil
of
perugino
pinturicchio
being
friend
of
raphael
and
knowing
him
to
be
draughtsman
of
highest
quality
to
help
with
cartoons
and
very
likely
designs
for
fresco
series
in
piccolomini
library
in
siena
cathedral
he
was
evidently
already
much
in
demand
even
at
this
early
stage
in
his
career
the
mond
crucifixion
very
much
in
style
of
perugino

coronation

raphael
led
nomadic
life
working
in
various
centres
in
northern
italy
but
spent
good
deal
of
time
in
florence
perhaps
from
about
although
there
is
traditional
reference
to
florentine
period
of
about
he
was
possibly
never
continuous
resident
there
he
may
have
needed
to
visit
city
to
secure
materials
in
any
case
there
is
letter
of
recommendation
of
raphael
dated
october
from
mother
of
next
duke
of
urbino
to
gonfaloniere
of
florence
the
bearer
of
this
will
be
found
to
be
raphael
painter
of
urbino
who
being
greatly
gifted
in
his
profession
has
determined
to
spend
some
time
in
florence
to
study
and
because
his
father
was
most
worthy
and
i
was
very
attached
to
him
and
son
is
sensible
and
wellmannered
young
man
on
both
accounts
i
bear
him
great
love
as
earlier
with
perugino
and
others
raphael
was
able
to
assimilate
influence
of
florentine
art
whilst
keeping
his
own
developing
style
frescos
in
perugia
of
about
show
new
monumental
quality
in
figures
which
may
represent
influence
of
fra
bartolomeo
who
vasari
says
was
friend
of
raphael
but
most
striking
influence
in
work
of
these
years
is
leonardo
da
vinci
who
returned
to
city
from
to
raphaels
figures
begin
to
take
more
dynamic
and
complex
positions
and
though
as
yet
his
painted
subjects
are
still
mostly
tranquil
he
made
drawn
studies
of
fighting
nude
men
one
of
obsessions
of
period
in
florence
another
drawing
is
portrait
of
young
woman
that
uses
threequarter
length
pyramidal
composition
of
justcompleted
mona
lisa
but
still
looks
completely
raphaelesque
another
of
leonardos
compositional
inventions
pyramidal
holy
family
was
repeated
in
series
of
works
that
remain
among
his
most
famous
easel
paintings
there
is
drawing
by
raphael
in
royal
collection
of
leonardos
lost
leda
and
swan
from
which
he
adapted
contrapposto
pose
of
his
own
saint
catherine
of
alexandria
he
also
perfects
his
own
version
of
leonardos
sfumato
modelling
to
give
subtlety
to
his
painting
of
flesh
and
develops
interplay
of
glances
between
his
groups
which
are
much
less
enigmatic
than
those
of
leonardo
but
he
keeps
soft
clear
light
of
perugino
in
his
paintings
leonardo
was
more
than
thirty
years
older
than
raphael
but
michelangelo
who
was
in
rome
for
this
period
was
just
eight
years
his
senior
michelangelo
already
disliked
leonardo
and
in
rome
came
to
dislike
raphael
even
more
attributing
conspiracies
against
him
to
younger
man
raphael
would
have
been
aware
of
his
works
in
florence
but
in
his
most
original
work
of
these
years
he
strikes
out
in
different
direction
his
deposition
of
christ
draws
on
classical
sarcophagi
to
spread
figures
across
front
of
picture
space
in
complex
and
not
wholly
successful
arrangement
wllflin
detects
in
kneeling
figure
on
right
influence
of
madonna
in
michelangelos
doni
tondo
but
rest
of
composition
is
far
removed
from
his
style
or
that
of
leonardo
though
highly
regarded
at
time
and
much
later
forcibly
removed
from
perugia
by
borghese
it
stands
rather
alone
in
raphaels
work
his
classicism
would
later
take
less
literal
direction
the
ansidei
madonna
c
beginning
to
move
on
from
perugino
the
madonna
of
meadow
c
using
leonardos
pyramidal
composition
for
subjects
of

possibly
echoes

of
leonardos
leda
deposition
of
christ
drawing
from
roman
sarcophagi
roman
period
vatican
stanze
in
raphael
moved
to
rome
where
he
resided
for
rest
of
his
life
he
was
invited
by
new
pope
julius
ii
perhaps
at
suggestion
of
his
architect
donato
bramante
then
engaged
on
st
peters
basilica
who
came
from
just
outside
urbino
and
was
distantly
related
to
raphael
unlike
michelangelo
who
had
been
kept
lingering
in
rome
for
several
months
after
his
first
summons
raphael
was
immediately
commissioned
by
julius
to
fresco
what
was
intended
to
become
popes
private
library
at
vatican
palace
this
was
much
larger
and
more
important
commission
than
any
he
had
received
before
he
had
only
painted
one
altarpiece
in
florence
itself
several
other
artists
and
their
teams
of
assistants
were
already
at
work
on
different
rooms
many
painting
over
recently
completed
paintings
commissioned
by
juliuss
loathed
predecessor
alexander
vi
whose
contributions
and
arms
julius
was
determined
to
efface
from
palace
michelangelo
meanwhile
had
been
commissioned
to
paint
sistine
chapel
ceiling
the
parnassus
stanza
della
segnatura
this
first
of
famous
stanze
or
raphael
rooms
to
be
painted
now
known
as
stanza
della
segnatura
after
its
use
in
vasaris
time
was
to
make
stunning
impact
on
roman
art
and
remains
generally
regarded
as
his
greatest
masterpiece
containing
the
school
of
athens
the
parnassus
and
disputa
raphael
was
then
given
further
rooms
to
paint
displacing
other
artists
including
perugino
and
signorelli
he
completed
sequence
of
three
rooms
each
with
paintings
on
each
wall
and
often
ceilings
too
increasingly
leaving
work
of
painting
from
his
detailed
drawings
to
large
and
skilled
workshop
team
he
had
acquired
who
added
fourth
room
probably
only
including
some
elements
designed
by
raphael
after
his
early
death
in
the
death
of
julius
in
did
not
interrupt
work
at
all
as
he
was
succeeded
by
raphaels
last
pope
medici
pope
leo
x
with
whom
raphael
formed
even
closer
relationship
and
who
continued
to
commission
him
raphaels
friend
cardinal
bibbiena
was
also
one
of
leos
old
tutors
and
close
friend
and
advisor
raphael
was
clearly
influenced

michelangelos
sistine

in
course
of
painting
room
vasari
said
bramante
let
him
in
secretly
the
first
section
was
completed
in
and
reaction
of
other
artists
to
daunting
force
of
michelangelo
was
dominating
question
in
italian
art
for
following
few
decades
raphael
who
had
already
shown
his
gift
for
absorbing
influences
into
his
own
personal
style
rose
to
challenge
perhaps
better
than
any
other
artist
one
of
first
and
clearest
instances
was
portrait
in
the
school
of
athens
of

michelangelo
accused

of

and

complained
in

that
everything
he
knew
about

he
got
from
me
although
other
quotations
show
more
generous
reactions
these
very
large
and
complex
compositions
have
been
regarded
ever
since
as
among
supreme
works
of
grand
manner
of
high
renaissance
and
classic
art
of
postantique
west
they
give
highly
idealised
depiction
of
forms
represented
and
compositions
though
very
carefully
conceived
in
drawings
achieve
sprezzatura
term
invented
by
his
friend
castiglione
who
defined
it
as
certain
nonchalance
which
conceals
all
artistry
and
makes
whatever
one
says
or
does
seem
uncontrived
and
effortless
according
to
michael
levey
raphael
gives
his
figures
superhuman
clarity

the

it

in

of
the
expulsion
of

from

he
designed
several
other
buildings
and
for
short
time
was
most
important
architect
in
rome
working
for
small
circle
around
papacy
julius
had
made
changes
to
street
plan
of
rome
creating
several
new

and
he
wanted
them
filled
with
splendid

an
important

branconio
was
completely
destroyed
to

for
berninis

but
drawings

the

was
unusually
richly
decorated
one
for
period
including
both
painted

on

of
three
and
much

on

the

speculatively
he

by

even
incomplete
it
was
most
sophisticated

was
required
to

within
three
days
and
stonemasons
were
not
allowed
to
destroy

without
permission
raphael
wrote
letter
to

suggesting
ways
of
halting
destruction
of
ancient
monuments
and
proposed
visual
survey
of

raphaels
youthful

saddened
men
of

because
he
was
not
able
to
furnish
description
and
painting
of

that
he
was
making
which
was

the

it
is
possible
that
raphael
saw
finished

before
his

were
probably
completed

also

workshop
vasari
says
that
raphael
eventually
had
workshop
of
fifty
pupils
and
assistants
many
of
whom
later
became
significant
artists
in
their
own
right
this
was
arguably
largest
workshop
team
assembled
under
any
single
old
master
painter
and
much
higher
than
norm
they
included
established
masters
from
other
parts
of
italy
probably
working
with
their
own
teams
as
subcontractors
as
well
as
pupils
and
journeymen
we
have
very
little
evidence
of
internal
working
arrangements
of
workshop
apart
from
works
of
art
themselves
which
are
often
very
difficult
to
assign
to
particular
hand
the
most
important
figures
were
giulio
romano
young
pupil
from
rome
only
about
twentyone
at
raphaels
death
and
gianfrancesco
penni
already
florentine
master
they
were
left
many
of
raphaels
drawings
and
other
possessions
and
to
some
extent
continued
workshop
after
raphaels
death
penni
did
not
achieve
personal
reputation
equal
to
giulios
as
after
raphaels
death
he
became
giulios
lessthanequal
collaborator
in
turn
for
much
of
his
subsequent
career
perino
del
vaga
already
master
and
polidoro
da
caravaggio
who
was
supposedly
promoted
from
labourer
carrying
building
materials
on
site
also
became
notable
painters
in
their
own
right
polidoros
partner
maturino
da
firenze
has
like
penni
been
overshadowed
in
subsequent
reputation
by
his
partner
giovanni
da
udine
had
more
independent
status
and
was
responsible
for
decorative
stucco
work
and
grotesques
surrounding
main
frescoes
most
of
artists
were
later
scattered
and
some
killed
by
violent
sack
of
rome
in
this
did
however
contribute
to
diffusion
of
versions
of
raphaels
style
around
italy
and
beyond
vasari
emphasises
that
raphael
ran
very
harmonious
and
efficient
workshop
and
had
extraordinary
skill
in
smoothing
over
troubles
and
arguments
with
both
patrons
and
his
assistants
contrast
with
stormy
pattern
of
michelangelos
relationships
with
both
however
though
both
penni
and
giulio
were
sufficiently
skilled
that
distinguishing
between
their
hands
and
that
of
raphael
himself
is
still
sometimes
difficult
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
of
raphaels
later
wallpaintings
and
probably
some
of
his
easel
paintings
are
more
notable
for
their
design
than
their
execution
many
of
his
portraits
if
in
good
condition
show
his
brilliance
in
detailed
handling
of
paint
right
up
to
end
of
his

raphael
was
one
of
finest
draftsmen
in
history
of
western
art
and
used
drawings
extensively
to
plan
his
compositions
according
to
nearcontemporary
when
beginning
to
plan
composition
he
would
lay
out
large
number
of
stock
drawings
of
his
on
floor
and
begin
to
draw
rapidly
borrowing
figures
from
here
and
there
over
forty
sketches
survive
for
disputa
in
stanze
and
there
may
well
have
been
many
more
originally
over
four
hundred
sheets
survive
altogether
he
used
different
drawings
to
refine
his
poses
and
compositions
apparently
to
greater
extent
than
most
other
painters
to
judge
by
number
of
variants
that
survive
this
is
how
raphael
himself
who
was
so
rich
in
inventiveness
used
to
work
always
coming
up
with
four
or
six
ways
to
show
narrative
each
one
different
from
rest
and
all
of
them
full
of
grace
and
well
done

raphael
made
no
prints
himself
but
entered
into
collaboration
with
marcantonio
raimondi
to
produce
engravings
to
raphaels
designs
which
created
many
of
most
famous
italian
prints
of
century
and
was
important
in
rise
of
reproductive
print
his
interest
was
unusual
in
such
major
artist
from
his
contemporaries
it
was
only
shared
by
titian
who
had
worked
much
less
successfully
with
raimondi
a
total
of
about
fifty
prints
were
made
some
were
copies
of
raphaels
paintings
but
other
designs
were
apparently
created
by
raphael
purely
to
be
turned
into
prints
raphael
made
preparatory
drawings
many
of
which
survive
for
raimondi
to
translate
into
engraving
the
most
famous
original
prints
to
result
from
collaboration
were

the

two
virtually
identical
versions
were
engraved

the

with
considerable
differences
and
galatea
were
also

well

in

illness

composed
enough
to
confess
his
sins
receive
last
rites
and
put
his
affairs
in
order
he
dictated
his
will
in

raphael
was
highly
admired
by
his
contemporaries
although
his
influence
on
artistic
style
in
his
own
century
was
less
than
that
of
michelangelo
mannerism
beginning
at
time
of
his
death
and
later
baroque
took
art
in
direction
totally
opposed
to
raphaels
qualities
with
raphaels
death
classic
art
high
renaissance
subsided
as
walter
friedlnder
put
it
he
was
soon
seen
as
ideal
model
by
those
disliking
excesses
of
mannerism
opinion
was
generally
held
in
middle
of
sixteenth
century
that
raphael
was
ideal
balanced
painter
universal
in
his
talent
satisfying
all
absolute
standards
and
obeying
all
rules
which
were
supposed
to
govern
arts
whereas
michelangelo
was
eccentric
genius
more
brilliant
than
any
other
artists
in
his
particular
field
drawing
of
male
nude
but
unbalanced
and
lacking
in
certain
qualities
such
as
grace
and
restraint
essential
to
great
artist
those
like
dolce
and
aretino
who
held
this
view
were
usually
survivors
of
renaissance
humanism
unable
to
follow
michelangelo
as
he
moved
on
into
mannerism
vasari
himself
despite
his
hero
remaining
michelangelo
came
to
see
his
influence
as
harmful
in
some
ways
and
added
passages
to
second
edition
of
lives
expressing
similar
views
raphael
and
maria
bibbienas
tomb

raphaels

raphaels
compositions
were
always
admired
and
studied
and
became
cornerstone
of
training
of
academies
of
art
his
period
of
greatest
influence
was
from
late
th
to
late
th
centuries
when
his
perfect
decorum
and
balance
were
greatly
admired
he
was
seen
as
best
model
for
history
painting
regarded
as
highest
in
hierarchy
of
genres
sir
joshua
reynolds
in
his
discourses
praised
his
simple
grave
and
majestic
dignity
and
said
he
stands
in
general
foremost
of
first
ie
best
painters
especially
for
his
frescoes
in
which
he
included
raphael
cartoons
whereas
michael
angelo
claims
next
attention
he
did
not
possess
so
many
excellences
as
raffaelle
but
those
he
had
were
of
highest
kind
echoing
sixteenthcentury
views
above
reynolds
goes
on
to
say
of
raphael
the
excellency
of
this
extraordinary
man
lay
in
propriety
beauty
and
majesty
of
his
characters
his
judicious
contrivance
of
his
composition
correctness
of
drawing
purity
of
taste
and
skilful
accommodation
of
other
mens
conceptions
to
his
own
purpose
nobody
excelled
him
in
that
judgment
with
which
he
united
to
his
own
observations
on
nature
energy
of
michael
angelo
and
beauty
and
simplicity
of
antique
to
question
therefore
which
ought
to
hold
first
rank
raffaelle
or
michael
angelo
it
must
be
answered
that
if
it
is
to
be
given
to
him
who
possessed
greater
combination
of
higher
qualities
of
art
than
any
other
man
there
is
no
doubt
but
raffaelle
is
first
but
if
according
to
longinus
sublime
being
highest
excellence
that
human
composition
can
attain
to
abundantly
compensates
absence
of
every
other
beauty
and
atones
for
all
other
deficiencies
then
michael
angelo
demands
preference
reynolds
was
less
enthusiastic
about
raphaels
panel
paintings
but
slight
sentimentality
of
these
made
them
enormously
popular
in
th
century
we
have
been
familiar
with
them
from
childhood
onwards
through
far
greater
mass
of
reproductions
than
any
other
artist
in
world
has
ever
had
wrote
wlfflin
who
was
born
in
of
raphaels
madonnas
in
germany
raphael
had
immense
influence
on
religious
art
of
nazarene
movement
and
dsseldorf
school
of
painting
in
th
century
in
contrast
in
england
preraphaelite
brotherhood
explicitly
reacted
against
his
influence
and
that
of
his
admirers
such
as
joshua
reynolds
seeking
to
return
to
styles
that
predated
what
they
saw
as
his
baneful
influence
according
to
critic
whose
ideas
greatly
influenced
them
john
ruskin
the
doom
of
arts
of
europe
went
forth
from
that
chamber
stanza
della
segnatura
and
it
was
brought
about
in
great
part
by
very
excellencies
of
man
who
had
thus
marked
commencement
of
decline
the
perfection
of
execution
and
beauty
of
feature
which
were
attained
in
his
works
and
in
those
of
his
great
contemporaries
rendered
finish
of
execution
and
beauty
of
form
chief
objects
of
all
artists
and
thenceforward
execution
was
looked
for
rather
than
thought
and
beauty
rather
than
veracity
and
as
i
told
you
these
are
two
secondary
causes
of
decline
of
art
first
being
loss
of
moral
purpose
pray
note
them
clearly
in
medival
art
thought
is
first
thing
execution
second
in
modern
art
execution
is
first
thing
and
thought
second
and
again
in
medival
art
truth
is
first
beauty
second
in
modern
art
beauty
is
first
truth
second
the
medival
principles
led
up
to
raphael
and
modern
principles
lead
down
from
him
by
raphaels
popularity
was
surpassed
by
michelangelo
and
leonardo
perhaps
as
reaction
against
etiolated
raphaelism
of
thcentury
academic
artists
such
as
bouguereau
although
art
historian
bernard
berenson
in
termed
raphael
most
famous
and
most
loved
master
of
high
renaissance
art
historians
leopold
and
helen
ettlinger
say
that
raphaels
lesser
popularity
in
th
century
is
made
obvious
by
contents
of
art
library
shelves
in
contrast
to
volume
upon
volume
that
reproduce
yet
again
detailed
photographs
of
sistine
ceiling
or
leonardos
drawings
literature
on
raphael
particularly
in
english
is
limited
to
only
few
books
they
conclude
nonetheless
that
of
all
great
renaissance
masters
raphaels
influence
is
most
continuous

he
is

raphaels
age
at
death
is
debated
by
some
with
michiel
asserting
that
raphael
died
at
while
pandolfo
pico
and
girolamo
lippomano
arguing
that
he
died
at
whereas
michiel
said
he
died
on
his
birthday
art
historian
john
shearman
addressed
this
apparent
discrepancy
the
time
of
death
can
be
calculated
from
convention
of
counting
from
sundown
which
michaelis
puts
at
on
friday
april
plus
halfhour
to
ave
maria
plus
three
hours
that
is
soon
after
pm
the
coincidence
noted
between
birthdate
and
deathdate
is
usually
thought
in
this
case
since
it
refers
to
friday
and
saturday
in
holy
week
movable
feast
rather
than
day
of
month
to
fortify
argument
that
raphael
was
also
born
on
good
friday
ie
march
but
there
is
notable
ambiguity
in
michiels
note
not
often
noticed
morse
venerdi
santo
venendo
il
sabato
giorno
della
sua
nativita
may
also
be
taken
to
mean
that
his
birthday
was
on
saturday
and
in
that
case
awareness
could
as
well
be
date
thus
producing
birthdate
of
april
bufarale
diagnosed
pneumonia
or
military
fever
while
portigliotti
suggested
pulmonary
disease
joannides
stated
that
raphael
died

polemarchus
tells
socrates
to
join
him
for
romp
socrates
then
asks
cephalus
polemarchus
and
thrasymachus
their
definitions
of
justice
cephalus
defines
justice
as
giving
what
is
owed
polemarchus
says
justice
is
art
which
gives
good
to
friends
and
evil
to
enemies
thrasymachus
proclaims
justice
is
nothing
else
than
interest
of
stronger
socrates
overturns
their
definitions
and
says
that
it
is
to
ones
advantage
to
be
just
and
disadvantage
to
be
unjust
the
first
book
ends
in
aporia
concerning
its
essence
book
iiedit
socrates
believes
he
has
answered
thrasymachus
and
is
done
with
discussion
of
justice
socrates
young
companions
glaucon
and
adeimantus
continue
argument
of
thrasymachus
for
sake
of
furthering
discussion
glaucon
gives
lecture
in
which
he
argues
first
that
origin
of
justice
was
in
social
contracts
aimed
at
preventing
one
from
suffering
injustice
and
being
unable
to
take
revenge
second
that
all
those
who
practice
justice
do
so
unwillingly
and
out
of
fear
of
punishment
and
third
that
life
of
unjust
man
is
far
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
glaucon
would
like
socrates
to
prove
that
justice
is
not
only
desirable
but
that
it
belongs
to
highest
class
of
desirable
things
those
desired
both
for
their
own
sake
and
their
consequences
to
demonstrate
problem
he
tells
story
of
gyges
who
with
help
of
ring
that
turns
him
invisible
achieves
great
advantages
for
himself
by
committing
injustices
after
glaucons
speech
adeimantus
adds
that
in
this
thought
experiment
unjust
should
not
fear
any
sort
of
divine
judgement
in
afterlife
since
very
poets
who
wrote
about
such
judgement
also
wrote
that
gods
would
grant
forgiveness
to
those
humans
who
made
ample
religious
sacrifice
adeimantus
demonstrates
his
reason
by
drawing
two
detailed
portraits
that
unjust
man
could
grow
wealthy
by
injustice
devoting
percentage
of
this
gain
to
religious
losses
thus
rendering
him
innocent
in
eyes
of
gods
socrates
suggests
that
they
look
for
justice
in
city
rather
than
in
individual
man
after
attributing
origin
of
society
to
individual
not
being
selfsufficient
and
having
many
needs
which
he
cannot
supply
himself
they
go
on
to
describe
development
of
city
socrates
first
describes
healthy
state
but
glaucon
asks
him
to
describe
city
of
pigs
as
he
finds
little
difference
between
two
he
then
goes
on
to
describe
luxurious
city
which
he
calls
fevered
state
this
requires
guardian
class
to
defend
and
attack
on
its
account
this
begins
discussion
concerning
type
of
education
that
ought
to
be
given
to
these
guardians
in
their
early
years
including
topic
of
what
kind
of
stories
are
appropriate
they
conclude
that
stories
that
ascribe
evil
to
gods
are
untrue
and
should
not
be
taught
book
iiiedit
socrates
and
his
companions
adeimantus
and
glaucon
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
education
socrates
breaks
educational
system
into
two
they
suggest
that
guardians
should
be
educated
in
these
four
virtues
wisdom
courage
justice
and
temperance
they
also
suggest
that
second
part
of
guardians
education
should
be
in
gymnastics
with
physical
training
they
will
be
able
to
live
without
needing
frequent
medical
attention
physical
training
will
help
prevent
illness
and
weakness
socrates
asserts
that
both
male
and
female
guardians
be
given
same
education
that
all
wives
and
children
be
shared
and
that
they
be
prohibited
from
owning
private
property
book
ivedit
socrates
and
his
companions
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
lifestyle
of
guardians
thus
concluding
their
initial
assessment
of
city
as
whole
socrates
assumes
each
person
will
be
happy
engaging
in
occupation
that
suits
them
best
if
city
as
whole
is
happy
then
individuals
are
happy
in
physical
education
and
diet
of
guardians
emphasis
is
on
moderation
since
both
poverty
and
excessive
wealth
will
corrupt
them
a
without
controlling
their
education
city
cannot
control
future
rulers
socrates
says
that
it
is
pointless
to
worry
over
specific
laws
like
those
pertaining
to
contracts
since
proper
education
ensures
lawful
behavior
and
poor
education
causes
lawlessness
ac
socrates
proceeds
to
search
for
wisdom
courage
and
temperance
in
city
on
grounds
that
justice
will
be
easier
to
discern
in
what
remains
e
they
find
wisdom
among
guardian
rulers
courage
among
guardian
warriors
or
auxiliaries
temperance
among
all
classes
of
city
in
agreeing
about
who
should
rule
and
who
should
be
ruled
finally
socrates
defines
justice
in
city
as
state
in
which
each
class
performs
only
its
own
work
not
meddling
in
work
of
other
classes
b
the
virtues
discovered
in
city
are
then
sought
in
individual
soul
for
this
purpose
socrates
creates
analogy
between
parts
of
city
and
soul
citysoul
analogy
he
argues
that
psychological
conflict
points
to
divided
soul
since
completely
unified
soul
could
not
behave
in
opposite
ways
towards
same
object
at
same
time
and
in
same
respect
b
he
gives
examples
of
possible
conflicts
between
rational
spirited
and
appetitive
parts
of
soul
corresponding
to
rulers
auxiliaries
and
producing
classes
in
city
having
established
tripartite
soul
socrates
defines
virtues
of
individual
a
person
is
wise
if
he
is
ruled
by
part
of
soul
that
knows
what
is
beneficial
for
each
part
and
for
whole
courageous
if
his
spirited
part
preserves
in
midst
of
pleasures
and

socrates
is
overwhelmed
at
their
request
categorizing
it

three

true
philosopher
with

will
facilitate
harmonious
cooperation
of
all
citizens
of
city
governance
of

is
likened

ship

this
philosopherking
must
be
intelligent
reliable
and
willing
to
lead
simple
life
however
these
qualities
are
rarely
manifested
on
their
own
and
so
they
must
be
encouraged
through
education
and
study
of
good
just
as
visible
objects
must
be
illuminated
in

must
also

socrates
discusses
four
unjust
constitutions
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
he
argues
that
society
will
decay
and
pass
through
each
government
in
succession
eventually
becoming
tyranny
most
unjust
regime
of
all
the
starting
point
is
imagined
alternate
aristocracy
ruled
by
philosopherking
just
government
dominated
by
wisdomloving
element
when
its
social
structure
breaks
down
and
enters
civil
war
it
is
replaced
by
timocracy
the
timocratic
government
is
dominated
by
spirited
element
with
ruling
class
of
propertyowners
consisting
of
warriors
or
generals
ancient
sparta
is
example
as
emphasis
on
honor
is
compromised
by
wealth
accumulation
it
is
replaced
by
oligarchy
the
oligarchic
government
is
dominated
by
desiring
element
in
which
rich
are
ruling
class
the
gap
between
rich
and
poor
widens
culminating
in
revolt
by
underclass
majority
establishing
democracy
democracy
emphasizes
maximum
freedom
so
power
is
distributed
evenly
it
is
also
dominated
by
desiring
element
but
in
undisciplined
unrestrained
way
the
populism
of
democratic
government
leads
to
mob
rule
fueled
by
fear
of
oligarchy
which
clever
demagogue
can
exploit
to
take
power
and
establish
tyranny
in
tyrannical
government
city
is
enslaved
to
tyrant
who
uses
his
guards
to
remove
best
social
elements
and
individuals
from
city
to
retain
power
since
they
pose
threat
while
leaving
worst
he
will
also
provoke
warfare
to
consolidate
his
position
as
leader
in
this
way
tyranny
is
most
unjust
regime
of
all
in
parallel
to
this
socrates
considers
individual
or
soul
that
corresponds
to
each
of
these
regimes
he
describes
how
aristocrat
may
become
weak
or
detached
from
political
and
material
affluence
and
how
his
son
will
respond
to
this
by
becoming
overly
ambitious
the
timocrat
in
turn
may
be
defeated
by
courts
or
vested
interests
his
son
responds
by
accumulating
wealth
in
order
to
gain
power
in
society
and
defend
himself
against
same
predicament
thereby
becoming
oligarch
the
oligarchs
son
will
grow
up
with
wealth
without
having
to
practice
thrift
or
stinginess
and
will
be
tempted
and
overwhelmed
by
his
desires
so
that
he
becomes
democratic
valuing
freedom
above
all
book
ixedit
having
discussed
tyrannical
constitution
of
city
socrates
wishes
to
discuss
tyrannical
constitution
of
psyche
this
is
all
intended
to
answer
thrasymachus
first
argument
in
book
i
that
life
of
unjust
man
here
understood
as
true
tyrant
is
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
philosopherking
first
he
describes
how
tyrannical
man
develops
from
democratic
household
the
democratic
man
is
torn
between
tyrannical
passions
and
oligarchic
discipline
and
ends
up
in
middle
ground
valuing
all
desires
both
good
and
bad
the
tyrant
will
be
tempted
in
same
way
as
democrat
but
without
upbringing
in
discipline
or
moderation
to
restrain
him
therefore
his
most
base
desires
and
wildest
passions
overwhelm
him
and
he
becomes
driven
by
lust
using
force
and
fraud
to
take
whatever
he
wants
the
tyrant
is
both
slave
to
his
lusts
and
master
to
whomever
he
can
enslave
because
of
this
tyranny
is
regime
with
least
freedom
and
happiness
and
tyrant
is
most
unhappy
of
all
since
regime
and
soul
correspond
his
desires
are
never
fulfilled
and
he
always
must
live
in
fear
of
his
victims
because
tyrant
can
only
think
in
terms
of
servant
and
master
he
has
no
equals
whom
he
can
befriend
and
with
no
friends
tyrant
is
robbed
of
freedom
this
is
first
proof
that
it
is
better
to
be
just
than
unjust
the
second
proof
is
derived
from
tripartite
theory
of
soul
the
wisdomloving
soul
is
best
equipped
to
judge
what
is
best
through
reason
and
wise
individual
judges
wisdom
to
be
best
then
honor
then
desire
this
is
just
proportion
for
city
or
soul
and
stands
opposite
to
tyranny
which
is
entirely
satiated
on
base
desires
the
third
proof
follows
from
this
he
describes
how
soul
can
be
misled
into
experiencing
false
pleasure
for
example
lack
of
pain
can
seem
pleasurable
by
comparison
to
worse
state
true
pleasure
is
had
by
being
fulfilled
by
things
that
fit
ones
nature
wisdom
is
most
fulfilling
and
is
best
guide
so
only
way
for
three
drives
of
soul
to
function
properly
and
experience
truest
pleasure
is
by
allowing
wisdom
to
lead
to
conclude
third
proof
wisdom
element
is
best
at
providing
pleasure
while
tyranny
is
worst
because
it
is
furthest
removed
from
wisdom
finally
socrates
considers
multiple
of
how
much
worse
tyranny
is
than
kinglydisciplinedwise
temperament
and
even
quantifies
tyrant
as
living
times
more
painfullyless
joyfully
than
king
he
then
gives
example
of
chimera
to
further
illustrate
justice
and
tripartite
soul
the
discussion
concludes
by
refuting
thrasymachus
argument
and
designating
most
blessed
life
as
that
of
just
man
and
most
miserable
life
as
that
of
unjust
man
book
xedit
concluding
theme
brought
up
most
explicitly
in
analogies
of
sun
and
divided
line
in
book
vi
socrates
finally
rejects
any
form
of
imitative
art
and
concludes
that
such
artists
have
no
place
in
just
city
he
continues
on
to
argue
for
immortality
of
psyche
and
even
espouses
theory
of
reincarnation
he
finishes
by
detailing
rewards
of
being
just
both
in
this
life
and
next
artists
create
things
but
they
are
only
different
copies
of
idea
of
original
and
whenever
any
one
informs
us
that
he
has
found
man
who
knows
all
arts
and
all
things
else
that
anybody
knows
and
every
single
thing
with
higher
degree
of
accuracy

any
other
manwhoever
tells
us
this
i

that
we
can
only
imagine
to
be
simple
creature
who
is
likely
to
have
been
deceived
by
some
wizard
or
actor
whom
he
met
and
whom
he
thought
allknowing
because
he
himself
was
unable
to
analyze
nature
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
and
imitation
and
same
object
appears
straight
when
looked
at
out
of
water
and
crooked
when
in
water
and
concave
becomes
convex
owing
to
illusion
about
colours
to
which
sight
is
liable
thus
every
sort
of
confusion
is
revealed
within
us
and
this
is
that
weakness
of
human
mind
on
which
art
of
conjuring
and
deceiving
by
light
and
shadow
and
other
ingenous
devices
imposes
having
effect
upon
us
like
magic
he
speaks
about
illusions
and
confusion
things
can
look
very
similar
but
be
different
in
reality
because
we
are
human
at
times
we
cannot

in

two
definitions
of
justice
are
proposed
but
deemed
inadequate
returning
debts
owed
and
helping
friends
while
harming
enemies
are
commonsense
definitions
of
justice
that
socrates
shows
are
inadequate
in
exceptional
situations
and
thus
lack
rigidity
demanded
of
definition
yet
he
does
not
completely
reject
them
for
each
expresses
commonsense
notion
of
justice
that
socrates
will
incorporate
into
his
discussion
of
just
regime
in
books
ii
through
v
at
end
of
book
i
socrates
agrees
with
polemarchus
that
justice
includes
helping
friends
but
says
just
man
would
never
do
harm
to
anybody
thrasymachus
believes
that
socrates
has
done
men
present
injustice
by
saying
this
and
attacks
his
character
and
reputation
in
front
of
group
partly
because
he
suspects
that
socrates
himself
does
not
even
believe
harming
enemies
is
unjust
thrasymachus
gives
his
understanding
of
justice
and
injustice
as
justice
is
what
is
advantageous
to
stronger
while
injustice
is
to
ones
own
profit
and
advantage

finds
this
definition

socrates
then
asks
whether
ruler

makes
mistake
by
making

that
lessens

to
undermine
thrasymachus
strict
definition
of
justice
by
comparing
rulers
to
people
of
various
professions
thrasymachus
consents
to
socrates
assertion
that
artist
is
someone
who
does
his
job
well
and
is
knower
of
some
art
which
allows
him
to
complete
job
well
in
so
doing
socrates
gets
thrasymachus
to
admit
that
rulers
who
enact
law
that
does
not
benefit
them
firstly
are
in
precise
sense
not
rulers
thrasymachus
gives
up
and
is
silent
from
then
on
socrates
has
trapped
thrasymachus
into
admitting
strong
man
who
makes
mistake
is
not
strong
man
in
precise
sense
and
that
some
type
of
knowledge
is
required
to
rule
perfectly
however
it
is
far
from
satisfactory
definition
of
justice
at
beginning
of
book
ii
platos
two
brothers
challenge
socrates
to
define
justice
in
man
and
unlike
rather
short
and
simple
definitions
offered
in
book
i
their
views
of
justice
are
presented
in
two
independent
speeches
glaucons
speech
reprises
thrasymachus
idea
of
justice
it
starts
with
legend
of
gyges
who
discovered
ring
socalled
ring
of
gyges
that
gave
him
power
to
become
invisible
glaucon
uses
this
story
to
argue
that
no
man
would
be
just
if
he
had
opportunity
of
doing
injustice
with
impunity
with
power
to
become
invisible
gyges
is
able
to
seduce
queen
murder
king
and
take
over
kingdom
glaucon
argues
that
just
as
well
as
unjust
man
would
do
same
if
they
had
power
to
get
away
with
injustice
exempt
from
punishment
the
only
reason
that
men
are
just
and
praise
justice
is
out
of
fear
of
being
punished
for
injustice
the
law
is
product
of
compromise
between
individuals
who
agree
not
to
do
injustice
to
others
if
others
will
not
do
injustice
to
them
glaucon
says
that
if
people
had
power
to
do
injustice
without
fear
of
punishment
they
would
not
enter
into
such
agreement
glaucon
uses
this
argument
to
challenge
socrates
to
defend
position
that
just
life
is
better
than
unjust
life
adeimantus
adds
to
glaucons
speech
charge
that
men
are
only
just
for
results
that
justice
brings
one
fortune
honor
reputation
adeimantus
challenges
socrates
to
prove
that
being
just
is
worth
something
in
and
of
itself
not
only
as
means
to
end
socrates
says
that
there
is
no
better
topic
to
debate
in
response
to
two
views
of
injustice
and
justice
presented
by
glaucon
and
adeimantus
he
claims
incompetence
but
feels
it
would
be
impious
to
leave
justice
in
such
doubt
thus
republic
sets
out
to
define
justice
given
difficulty
of
this
task
as
proven
in
book
i
socrates
in
book
ii
leads
his
interlocutors
into
discussion
of
justice
in
city
which
socrates
suggests
may
help
them
see
justice
not
only
in
person
but
on
larger
scale
first
in
cities
searching
for
what
it
is
then
thusly
we
could
examine
also
in
some
individual
examining
likeness
of
bigger
in
idea
of
littler
ea
for
over
two
and
half
millennia
scholars
have
differed
on
aptness
of
citysoul
analogy
socrates
uses
to
find
justice
in
books
ii
through
v
the
republic
is
dramatic
dialogue
not
treatise
socrates
definition
of
justice
is
never
unconditionally
stated
only
versions
of
justice
within
each
city
are
found
and
evaluated
in
books
ii
through
book
v
socrates
constantly
refers
definition
of
justice
back
to
conditions
of
city
for
which
it
is
created
he
builds
series
of
myths
or
noble
lies
to
make
cities
appear
just
and
these
conditions
moderate
life
within
communities
the
earth
born
myth
makes
all
men
believe
that
they
are
born
from
earth
and
have
predestined
natures
within
their
veins
accordingly
socrates
defines
justice
as
working
at
that
to
which
he
is
naturally
best
suited
and
to
do
ones
own
business
and
not
to
be
busybody
ab
and
goes
on
to
say
that
justice
sustains
and
perfects
other
three
cardinal
virtues
temperance
wisdom
and
courage
and
that
justice
is
cause
and
condition
of
their
existence
socrates
does
not
include
justice
as
virtue
within
city
suggesting
that
justice
does
not
exist
within
human
soul
either
rather
it
is
result
of
well
ordered
soul
a
result
of
this
conception
of
justice
separates
people
into
three
types
that
of
soldier
that
of
producer
and
that
of
ruler
if
ruler
can
create
just
laws
and
if
warriors
can
carry
out
orders
of
rulers
and
if
producers
can
obey
this
authority
then
society
will
be
just
the
city
is
challenged
by
adeimantus
and
glaucon
throughout
its
development
adeimantus
cannot
find
happiness
in
city
and
glaucon
cannot
find
honor
and
glory
this
hypothetical
city
contains
no
private
property
no
marriage
or
nuclear
families
these
are
sacrificed
for
common
good
and
doing
what
is
best
fitting
to
ones
nature
in
book
v
socrates
addresses
question
of
naturalness
of
and
possibility
for
this
city
concluding
in
book
vi
that
citys
ontological
status
regards
construction
of
soul
not
of
actual
metropolis
the
rule
of
philosopherkings
appear
as
issue
of
possibility
is
raised
socrates
never
positively
states
what
justice
is
in
human
soulcity
it
appears
he
has
created
city
where
justice
is
not
found
but
can
be
lost
it
is
as
though
in
wellordered
state
justice
is
not
even
needed
since
community
satisfies
needs
of
humans
in
terms
of
why
it
is
best
to
be
just
rather
than
unjust
for
individual
plato
prepares
answer
in
book
ix
consisting
of
three
main
arguments
plato
says
that
tyrants
nature
will
leave
him
with
horrid
pains
and
pangs
and
that
typical
tyrant
engages
in
lifestyle
that
will
be
physically
and
mentally
exacting
on
such
ruler
such
disposition
is
in
contrast
to
truthloving
philosopherking
and
tyrant
never
tastes
of
true
freedom
or
friendship
the
second
argument
proposes
that
of
all
different
types
of
people
only
philosopher
is
able
to
judge
which
type
of
ruler
is
best
since
only
he
can
see
form
of
good
thirdly
plato
argues
pleasures
which
are
approved
of
by
lover
of
wisdom
and
reason
are
truest
in
sum
plato
argues
that
philosophical
pleasure
is
only
true
pleasure
since
other
pleasures
experienced
by
others
are
simply
neutral
state
free
of
pain
socrates
points
out
human
tendency
to
be
corrupted
by
power
leads
down
road
to
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
from
this
he
concludes
that
ruling
should
be
left
to
philosophers
who
are
most
just
and
therefore
least
susceptible
to
corruption
this
good
city
is
depicted
as
being
governed
by
philosopherkings
disinterested
persons
who
rule
not
for
their
personal
enjoyment
but
for
good
of
citystate
polis
the
philosophers
have
seen
forms
and
therefore
know
what
is
good
they
understand
corrupting
effect
of
greed
and
own
no
property
and
receive
no
salary
they
also
live
in
sober
communism
eating
and
sleeping
together
the
paradigmatic
society
which
stands
behind
every
historical
society
is
hierarchical
but
social
classes
have
marginal
permeability
there
are
no
slaves
no
discrimination
between
men
and
women
the
men
and
women
are
both
to
be
taught
same
things
so
they
are
both
able
to
be
used
for
same
things
e
in
addition
to
ruling
class
of
guardians
which
abolished
riches
there
is
class
of
private
producers
demiourgoi
who
may
be
rich
or
poor
a
number
of
provisions
aim
to
avoid
making
people
weak
substitution
of
universal
educational
system
for
men
and
women
instead
of
debilitating
music
poetry
and
theatre
startling
departure
from
greek
society
these
provisions
apply
to
all
classes
and
restrictions
placed
on
philosopherkings
chosen
from
warrior
class
and
warriors
are
much
more
severe
than
those
placed
on
producers
because
rulers
must
be
kept
away
from
any
source
of
corruption
in
books
vvi
abolition
of
riches
among
guardian
class
not
unlike
max
webers
bureaucracy
leads
controversially
to
abandonment
of
typical
family
and
as
such
no
child
may
know
his
or
her
parents
and
parents
may
not
know
their
own
children
socrates
tells
tale
which
is
allegory
of
good
government
the
rulers
assemble
couples
for
reproduction
based
on
breeding
criteria
thus
stable
population
is
achieved
through
eugenics
and
social
cohesion
is
projected
to
be
high
because
familial
links
are
extended
towards
everyone
in
city
also
education
of
youth
is
such
that
they
are
taught
of
only
works
of
writing
that
encourage
them
to
improve
themselves
for

envision
gods
as
entirely

viix
stand
platos
criticism
of
forms
of
government
it
begins
with
dismissal
of
timocracy
sort
of
authoritarian
regime
not
unlike
military
dictatorship
plato
offers
almost
psychoanalytical
explanation
of
timocrat
as
one
who
saw
his
father
humiliated
by
his
mother
and
wants
to
vindicate
manliness
the
third
worst
regime
is
oligarchy
rule
of
small
band
of
rich
people
millionaires
that
only
respect
money
then
comes
democratic
form
of
government
and
its
susceptibility
to
being
ruled
by
unfit
sectarian
demagogues
finally
worst
regime
is
tyranny
where
whimsical
desires
of

became

allegory
of
cave
and
theory
of
forms
the
republic
contains
platos
allegory
of
cave
with
which
he
explains
his
concept
of
forms
as
answer
to
problem
of
universals
the
allegory
of
cave
primarily
depicts
platos
distinction
between
world
of
appearances
and
real
world
of
forms
as
well
as
helping
to
justify
philosophers
place
in
society
as
king
plato
imagines
group
of
people
who
have
lived
their
entire
lives
as
prisoners
chained
to
wall
of
cave
in
subterranean
so
they
are
unable
to
see
outside
world
behind
them
however
constant
flame
illuminates
various
moving
objects
outside
which
are
silhouetted
on
wall
of
cave
visible
to
prisoners
these
prisoners
through
having
no
other
experience
of
reality
ascribe
forms
to
these
shadows
such
as
either
dog
or
cat
plato
then
goes
on
to
explain
how
philosopher
is
akin
to
prisoner
who
is
freed
from
cave
the
prisoner
is
initially
blinded
by
light
but
when
he
adjusts
to
brightness
he
sees
fire
and
statues
and
how
they
caused
images
witnessed
inside
cave
he
sees
that
fire
and
statues
in
cave
were
just
copies
of
real
objects
merely
imitations
this
is
analogous
to
forms
what
we
see
from
day
to
day
are
merely
appearances
reflections
of
forms
the
philosopher
however
will
not
be
deceived
by
shadows
and
will
hence
be
able
to
see
real
world
world
above
that
of
appearances
philosopher
will
gain
knowledge
of
things
in
themselves
in
this
analogy
sun
is
representative
of
good
this
is
main
object
of
philosophers
knowledge
the
good
can
be
thought
of
as
form
of
forms
or
structuring
of
world
as
whole
the
prisoners
stages
of
understanding
correlate
with
levels
on
divided
line
which
he
imagines
the
line
is
divided
into
what
visible
world
is
and
what
intelligible
world
is
with
divider
being
sun
when
prisoner
is
in
cave
he
is
obviously
in
visible
realm
that
receives
no
sunlight
and
outside
he
comes
to
be
in
intelligible
realm
the
shadows
witnessed
in
cave
correspond
to
lowest
level
on
platos
line
that
of
imagination
and
conjecture
once
prisoner
is
freed
and
sees
shadows
for
what
they
are
he
reaches
second
stage
on
divided
line
stage
of
belief
for
he
comes
to
believe
that
statues
in
cave
are
real
on
leaving
cave
however
prisoner
comes
to
see
objects
more
real
than
statues
inside
of
cave
and
this
correlates
with
third
stage
on
platos
line
thought
lastly
prisoner
turns
to
sun
which
he
grasps
as
source
of
truth
or
form
of
good
and
this
last
stage
named
as
dialectic
is
highest
possible
stage
on
line
the
prisoner
as
result
of
form
of
good
can
begin
to
understand
all
other
forms
in
reality
at
end
of
this
allegory
plato
asserts
that
it
is
philosophers
burden
to
reenter
cave
those
who
have
seen
ideal
world
he
says
have
duty
to
educate
those
in
material
world
since

recognizes
what
is
truly

narrate

about

with

and
adeimantus
in

eventually
turns
to
considering
four
regimes
that
exist
in

and
tend
to
degrade
successively
into
each
other
timocracy

also
called
plutocracy
democracy
and
tyranny
also
called
despotism
timocracy
socrates
defines
timocracy
as
government
of
people
who
love
rule
and
honor
socrates
argues
that
timocracy
emerges
from
aristocracy
due
to
civil
war
breaking
out
among
ruling
class
and
majority
over
time
many
more
births
will
occur
to
people
who
lack
aristocratic
guardian
qualities
slowly
drawing
populace
away
from
knowledge
music
poetry
and

education
toward
moneymaking
and
acquisition
of
possessions
this
civil
war
between
those
who
value
wisdom
and
those
who
value
material
acquisition
will
continue
until
compromise
is
reached
the
timocracy

war
insofar
as
it
satisfies

of
victory
and
honor
the
timocratic
man
loves
physical
training
and
hunting
and
values
his
abilities
in

oligarchy
temptations
create
confusion
between
economic
status
and
honor
which
is
responsible
for
emergence
of
oligarchy
in
book
viii
socrates
suggests
that
wealth
will
not
help
pilot
to
navigate
his
ship
as
his
concerns
will
be
directed
centrally
toward
increasing
his
wealth
by
whatever
means
rather
than
seeking
out
wisdom
or
honor
the
injustice
of
economic
disparity
divides
rich
and
poor
thus
creating
environment
for
criminals
and
beggars
to
emerge
the
rich
are
constantly
plotting
against
poor
and
vice
versa
the
oligarchic
constitution
is
based
on
property
assessment
and
wealth
qualification
unlike
timocracy
oligarchs
are
also
unable
to
fight
war
since
they
do
not
wish
to
arm
majority
for
fear
of
their
rising
up
against

hegeledit
hegel
respected
platos
theories
of
state
and
ethics
much
more
than
those
of
early
modern
philosophers
such
as
locke
hobbes
and
rousseau
whose
theories
proceeded
from
fictional
state
of
nature
defined
by
humanitys
natural
needs
desires
and
freedom
for
hegel
this
was
contradiction
since
nature
and
individual
are
contradictory
freedoms
which
define
individuality
as
such
are
latecomers
on
stage
of
history
therefore
these
philosophers
unwittingly
projected
man
as
individual
in
modern
society
onto
primordial
state
of
nature
plato
however
had
managed
to
grasp
ideas
specific
to
his
time
plato
is
not
man
to
dabble
in
abstract
theories
and
principles
his
truthloving
mind
has
recognized
and
represented
truth

he
lived

in
greece
itself
no
man
can
overleap
his
time
spirit
of
his
time
is
his
spirit
also
but
point
at
issue
is
to
recognize
that
spirit
by
its
content
for
hegel
platos
republic
is
not
abstract
theory
or
ideal
which
is
too
good
for
real
nature
of
man
but
rather
is
not
ideal
enough
not
good
enough
for
ideals
already
inherent

nascent

recognized

caught
up

it
forward
in

that
he

gadameredit
in
his
plato
und
die
dichter
plato
and
poets
as
well
as
several
other
works
hansgeorg
gadamer
describes
utopic
city
of
republic
as
heuristic
utopia
that
should
not
be
pursued
or
even
be
used
as
orientationpoint
for
political
development
rather
its
purpose
is
said
to
be
to
show
how
things
would
have
to
be
connected
and
how
one
thing
would
lead
to
anotheroften
with
highly
problematic
resultsif
one
would
opt
for
certain
principles
and
carry
them
through
rigorously
this
interpretation
argues
that
large
passages
in
platos
writing
are
ironic
line
of
thought
initially
pursued
by
kierkegaard
popperedit
the
city
portrayed
in
republic
struck
some
critics
as
harsh
rigid
and
unfree
indeed
as
totalitarian
karl
popper
gave
voice
to
that
view
in
his
book
the
open
society
and
its
enemies
where
he
singled
out
platos
state
as
dystopia
popper
distinguished
platos
ideas
from
those
of
socrates
claiming
that
former
in
his
later
years
expressed
none
of
humanitarian
and
democratic
tendencies
of
his
teacher
popper
thought
platos
envisioned
state
totalitarian
as
it
advocated
government
composed
only
of
distinct
hereditary
ruling
class
with
working
class
who
popper
argues
plato
regards
as
human
cattle
given
no
role
in
decision
making
he
argues
that
plato
has
no
interest
in
what
are
commonly
regarded
as
problems
of
justice
resolution
of
disputes
between
individuals
because
plato
has
redefined
justice
as
keeping
ones
place

eric
voegelin
in
plato
and
aristotle
baton
rouge
gave
meaning
to
concept
of
just
city
in
speech
books
iiv
for
instance
there
is
evidence
in
dialogue
that
socrates
himself
would
not
be
member
of
his
ideal
state
his
life
was
almost
solely
dedicated
to
private
pursuit
of
knowledge
more
practically
socrates
suggests
that
members
of
lower
classes
could
rise
to
higher
ruling
class
and
vice
versa
if
they
had
gold
in
their
veins
version
of
concept
of
social
mobility
the
exercise
of
power
is
built
on
noble
lie
that
all
men
are
brothers
born
of
earth
yet
there
is
clear
hierarchy
and
class
divisions
there
is
tripartite
explanation
of
human
psychology
that
is
extrapolated
to
city
relation
among
peoples
there
is
no
family
among
guardians
another
crude
version
of
max
webers
concept
of
bureaucracy
as
state
nonprivate
concern
together
with
leo
strauss
voegelin
considered
poppers
interpretation
to
be
gross
misunderstanding
not
only
of
dialogue
itself
but
of
very
nature
and
character
of
platos
entire
philosophic
enterprise
strauss
and
bloomedit
some
of
platos
proposals
have
led
theorists
like
leo
strauss
and
allan
bloom
to
ask
readers
to
consider
possibility
that
socrates
was
creating
not
blueprint
for
real
city
but
learning
exercise
for
young
men
in
dialogue
there
are
many
points
in
construction
of
just
city
in
speech
that
seem
contradictory
which
raise
possibility
socrates
is
employing
irony
to
make
men
in
dialogue
question
for
themselves
ultimate
value
of
proposals
in
turn
plato
has
immortalized
this
learning
exercise
in
republic
one
of
many
examples
is
that
socrates
calls
marriages
of
ruling
class
sacred
however
they
last
only
one
night
and
are
result
of
manipulating
and
drugging
couples
into
predetermined
intercourse
with
aim
of
eugenically
breeding
guardianwarriors
strauss
and
blooms
interpretations
however
involve
more
than
just
pointing
out
inconsistencies
by
calling
attention
to
these
issues
they
ask
readers
to
think
more
deeply
about
whether
plato
is
being
ironic
or
genuine
for
neither
strauss
nor
bloom
present
unequivocal
opinion
preferring
to
raise
philosophic
doubt
over
interpretive
fact
strausss
approach
developed
out
of
belief
that
plato
wrote
esoterically
the
basic
acceptance
of
exotericesoteric
distinction
revolves
around
whether
plato
really
wanted
to
see
just
city
in
speech
of
books
vvi
come
to
pass
or
whether
it
is
just
allegory
strauss
never
regarded
this
as
crucial
issue
of
dialogue
he
argued
against
karl
poppers
literal
view
citing
ciceros
opinion
that
republics
true
nature
was
to
bring
to
light
nature
of
political
things
in
fact
strauss
undermines
justice
found
in
just
city
in
speech
by
implying
city
is
not
natural
it
is
manmade
conceit
that
abstracts
away
from
erotic
needs
of
body
the
city
founded
in
republic
is
rendered
possible
by
abstraction
from
eros
an
argument
that
has
been
used
against
ascribing
ironic
intent
to
plato
is
that
platos
academy
produced
number
of
tyrants
who
seized
political
power
and
abandoned
philosophy
for
ruling
city
despite
being
wellversed
in
greek
and
having
direct
contact
with
plato
himself
some
of
platos
former
students
like
clearchus
tyrant
of
heraclea
chaeron
tyrant
of
pellene
erastus
and
coriscus
tyrants
of
skepsis
hermias
of
atarneus
and
assos
and
calippus
tyrant
of
syracuse
ruled
people
and
did
not
impose
anything
like
philosopherkingship
however
it
can
be
argued
whether
these
men
became
tyrants
through
studying
in
academy
platos
school
had
elite
student
body
some
of
whom
would
by
birth
and
family
expectation
end
up
in
seats
of
power
additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
that
these
men
were
tyrants
in
modern
totalitarian
sense
of
concept
finally
since
very
little
is
actually
known
about
what
was
taught
at
platos
academy
there
is
no
small
controversy
over
whether
it
was
even
in
business
of
teaching
politics
at
all
views
on
citysoul
analogyedit
many
critics
both
ancient
and
modern
like
julia
annas
have
suggested
that
dialogues
political
discussion
actually
serves
as
analogy
for
individual
soul
in
which
there
are
also
many
different
members
that
can
either
conflict
or
else
be
integrated
and
orchestrated
under
just
and
productive
government
among
other
things
this
analogical
reading
would
solve
problem
of
certain
implausible
statements
plato
makes
concerning
ideal
political
republic
norbert
blssner
argues
that
republic
is
best
understood
as
analysis
of
workings
and
moral
improvement
of
individual
soul
with
remarkable
thoroughness
and
clarity
this
view
of
course
does
not
preclude
legitimate
reading
of
republic
as
political
treatise
work
could
operate
at
both
levels
it
merely
implies
that
it
deserves
more
attention
as
work
on
psychology
and
moral
philosophy
than
it
has
sometimes
received
practicalityedit
the
abovementioned
views
have
in
common
that
they
view
republic
as
theoretical
work
not
as
set
of
guidelines
for
good
governance
however
popper
insists
that
republic
was
meant
by
its
author
not
so
much
as
theoretical
treatise
but
as
topical
political
manifesto
and
bertrand
russell
argues
that
at
least
in
intent
and
all
in
all
not
so
far
from
what
was
possible
in
ancient
greek
citystates
form
of
government
portrayed
in
republic
was
meant
as
practical
one
by
plato
st
centuryedit
one
of
platos
recurring
techniques
in
republic
is
to
refine
concept
of
justice
with
reference
to
various
examples
of
greater
or
lesser
injustice
however
in
the
concept
of
injustice
eric
heinze
challenges
assumption
that
justice
and
injustice
form
mutually
exclusive
pair
heinze
argues
that
such
assumption
traces
not
from
strict
deductive
logic
but
from
arbitrary
etymology
of
word
injustice
heinze
critiques
what
he
calls
classical
western
justice
theory
for
having
perpetuated
that
logical
error
which
first
appears
in
platos
republic
but
manifests
throughout
traditional
political
philosophy
in
thinkers
otherwise
as
different
as
aristotle
aquinas
locke
rousseau
hegel
and
marx

julian
baggini

almost
every
point

it

and

it

polemarchus
tells
socrates
to
join
him
for
romp
socrates
then
asks
cephalus
polemarchus
and
thrasymachus
their
definitions
of
justice
cephalus
defines
justice
as
giving
what
is
owed
polemarchus
says
justice
is
art
which
gives
good
to
friends
and
evil
to
enemies
thrasymachus
proclaims
justice
is
nothing
else
than
interest
of
stronger
socrates
overturns
their
definitions
and
says
that
it
is
to
ones
advantage
to
be
just
and
disadvantage
to
be
unjust
the
first
book
ends
in
aporia
concerning
its
essence
book
iiedit
socrates
believes
he
has
answered
thrasymachus
and
is
done
with
discussion
of
justice
socrates
young
companions
glaucon
and
adeimantus
continue
argument
of
thrasymachus
for
sake
of
furthering
discussion
glaucon
gives
lecture
in
which
he
argues
first
that
origin
of
justice
was
in
social
contracts
aimed
at
preventing
one
from
suffering
injustice
and
being
unable
to
take
revenge
second
that
all
those
who
practice
justice
do
so
unwillingly
and
out
of
fear
of
punishment
and
third
that
life
of
unjust
man
is
far
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
glaucon
would
like
socrates
to
prove
that
justice
is
not
only
desirable
but
that
it
belongs
to
highest
class
of
desirable
things
those
desired
both
for
their
own
sake
and
their
consequences
to
demonstrate
problem
he
tells
story
of
gyges
who
with
help
of
ring
that
turns
him
invisible
achieves
great
advantages
for
himself
by
committing
injustices
after
glaucons
speech
adeimantus
adds
that
in
this
thought
experiment
unjust
should
not
fear
any
sort
of
divine
judgement
in
afterlife
since
very
poets
who
wrote
about
such
judgement
also
wrote
that
gods
would
grant
forgiveness
to
those
humans
who
made
ample
religious
sacrifice
adeimantus
demonstrates
his
reason
by
drawing
two
detailed
portraits
that
unjust
man
could
grow
wealthy
by
injustice
devoting
percentage
of
this
gain
to
religious
losses
thus
rendering
him
innocent
in
eyes
of
gods
socrates
suggests
that
they
look
for
justice
in
city
rather
than
in
individual
man
after
attributing
origin
of
society
to
individual
not
being
selfsufficient
and
having
many
needs
which
he
cannot
supply
himself
they
go
on
to
describe
development
of
city
socrates
first
describes
healthy
state
but
glaucon
asks
him
to
describe
city
of
pigs
as
he
finds
little
difference
between
two
he
then
goes
on
to
describe
luxurious
city
which
he
calls
fevered
state
this
requires
guardian
class
to
defend
and
attack
on
its
account
this
begins
discussion
concerning
type
of
education
that
ought
to
be
given
to
these
guardians
in
their
early
years
including
topic
of
what
kind
of
stories
are
appropriate
they
conclude
that
stories
that
ascribe
evil
to
gods
are
untrue
and
should
not
be
taught
book
iiiedit
socrates
and
his
companions
adeimantus
and
glaucon
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
education
socrates
breaks
educational
system
into
two
they
suggest
that
guardians
should
be
educated
in
these
four
virtues
wisdom
courage
justice
and
temperance
they
also
suggest
that
second
part
of
guardians
education
should
be
in
gymnastics
with
physical
training
they
will
be
able
to
live
without
needing
frequent
medical
attention
physical
training
will
help
prevent
illness
and
weakness
socrates
asserts
that
both
male
and
female
guardians
be
given
same
education
that
all
wives
and
children
be
shared
and
that
they
be
prohibited
from
owning
private
property
book
ivedit
socrates
and
his
companions
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
lifestyle
of
guardians
thus
concluding
their
initial
assessment
of
city
as
whole
socrates
assumes
each
person
will
be
happy
engaging
in
occupation
that
suits
them
best
if
city
as
whole
is
happy
then
individuals
are
happy
in
physical
education
and
diet
of
guardians
emphasis
is
on
moderation
since
both
poverty
and
excessive
wealth
will
corrupt
them
a
without
controlling
their
education
city
cannot
control
future
rulers
socrates
says
that
it
is
pointless
to
worry
over
specific
laws
like
those
pertaining
to
contracts
since
proper
education
ensures
lawful
behavior
and
poor
education
causes
lawlessness
ac
socrates
proceeds
to
search
for
wisdom
courage
and
temperance
in
city
on
grounds
that
justice
will
be
easier
to
discern
in
what
remains
e
they
find
wisdom
among
guardian
rulers
courage
among
guardian
warriors
or
auxiliaries
temperance
among
all
classes
of
city
in
agreeing
about
who
should
rule
and
who
should
be
ruled
finally
socrates
defines
justice
in
city
as
state
in
which
each
class
performs
only
its
own
work
not
meddling
in
work
of
other
classes
b
the
virtues
discovered
in
city
are
then
sought
in
individual
soul
for
this
purpose
socrates
creates
analogy
between
parts
of
city
and
soul
citysoul
analogy
he
argues
that
psychological
conflict
points
to
divided
soul
since
completely
unified
soul
could
not
behave
in
opposite
ways
towards
same
object
at
same
time
and
in
same
respect
b
he
gives
examples
of
possible
conflicts
between
rational
spirited
and
appetitive
parts
of
soul
corresponding
to
rulers
auxiliaries
and
producing
classes
in
city
having
established
tripartite
soul
socrates
defines
virtues
of
individual
a
person
is
wise
if
he
is
ruled
by
part
of
soul
that
knows
what
is
beneficial
for
each
part
and
for
whole
courageous
if
his
spirited
part
preserves
in
midst
of
pleasures
and
pains
decisions
reached
by
rational
part
and
temperate
if
three
parts
agree
that
rational
part
lead
cd
they
are
just
if
each
part
of
soul
attends
to
its
function
and
not
function
of
another
it
follows
from
this
definition
that
one
cannot
be
just
if
one
doesnt
have
other
cardinal
virtues

socrates

to
his
satisfaction

and

moves
to
elaborate
upon
four
unjust
constitutions
of
these
adeimantus
and
polemarchus
interrupt
asking
socrates
instead
first
to
explain
how
sharing
of
wives
and
children
in
guardian
class
is
to
be
defined
and
legislated
theme
first
touched
on
in
book
iii
socrates
is
overwhelmed
at
their
request
categorizing
it
as
three
waves
of
attack
against
which
his
reasoning
must
stand
firm
these
three
waves
challenge
socrates
claims
that
both
male
and
female
guardians
ought
to
receive
same
education
human
reproduction
ought
to
be
regulated
by
state
and

such
city
and
its
corresponding
philosopherking
could
actually
come
to
be
in

book
viedit
socrates
argument
is
that
in
ideal
city
true
philosopher
with
understanding
of
forms
will
facilitate
harmonious
cooperation
of
all
citizens
of
city
governance
of
citystate
is
likened
to

of

ship
of

this
philosopherking
must
be
intelligent
reliable
and
willing
to
lead
simple
life
however
these
qualities
are
rarely
manifested
on
their
own
and
so
they
must
be
encouraged
through
education
and
study
of
good
just
as
visible
objects
must
be
illuminated
in
order
to
be
seen
so
must
also
be
true

elaborates
upon
immediately
preceding
analogies
of

of

in
which
he
insists
that
psyche
must
be
freed
from

he
continues

elaborating
upon

socrates
discusses
four
unjust
constitutions
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
he
argues
that
society
will
decay
and
pass
through
each
government
in
succession
eventually
becoming
tyranny
most
unjust
regime
of
all
the
starting
point
is
imagined
alternate
aristocracy
ruled
by
philosopherking
just
government
dominated
by
wisdomloving
element
when
its
social
structure
breaks
down
and
enters
civil
war
it
is
replaced
by
timocracy
the
timocratic
government
is
dominated
by
spirited
element
with
ruling
class
of
propertyowners
consisting
of
warriors
or
generals
ancient
sparta
is
example
as
emphasis
on
honor
is
compromised
by
wealth
accumulation
it
is
replaced
by
oligarchy
the
oligarchic
government
is
dominated
by
desiring
element
in
which
rich
are
ruling
class
the
gap
between
rich
and
poor
widens
culminating
in
revolt
by
underclass
majority
establishing
democracy
democracy
emphasizes
maximum
freedom
so
power
is
distributed
evenly
it
is
also
dominated
by
desiring
element
but
in
undisciplined
unrestrained
way
the
populism
of
democratic
government
leads
to
mob
rule
fueled
by
fear
of
oligarchy
which
clever
demagogue
can
exploit
to
take
power
and
establish
tyranny
in
tyrannical
government
city
is
enslaved
to
tyrant
who
uses
his
guards
to
remove
best
social
elements
and
individuals
from
city
to
retain
power
since
they
pose
threat
while
leaving
worst
he
will
also
provoke
warfare
to
consolidate
his
position
as
leader
in
this
way
tyranny
is
most
unjust
regime
of
all
in
parallel
to
this
socrates
considers
individual
or
soul
that
corresponds
to
each
of
these
regimes
he
describes
how
aristocrat
may
become
weak
or
detached
from
political
and
material
affluence
and
how
his
son
will
respond
to
this
by
becoming
overly
ambitious
the
timocrat
in
turn
may
be
defeated
by
courts
or
vested
interests
his
son
responds
by
accumulating
wealth
in
order
to
gain
power
in
society
and
defend
himself
against
same
predicament
thereby
becoming
oligarch
the
oligarchs
son
will
grow
up
with
wealth
without
having
to
practice
thrift
or
stinginess
and
will
be
tempted
and
overwhelmed
by
his
desires
so
that
he
becomes
democratic
valuing
freedom
above
all
book
ixedit
having
discussed
tyrannical
constitution
of
city
socrates
wishes
to
discuss
tyrannical
constitution
of
psyche
this
is
all
intended
to
answer
thrasymachus
first
argument
in
book
i
that
life
of
unjust
man
here
understood
as
true
tyrant
is
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
philosopherking
first
he
describes
how
tyrannical
man
develops
from
democratic
household
the
democratic
man
is
torn
between
tyrannical
passions
and
oligarchic
discipline
and
ends
up
in
middle
ground
valuing
all
desires
both
good
and
bad
the
tyrant
will
be
tempted
in
same
way
as
democrat
but
without
upbringing
in
discipline
or
moderation
to
restrain
him
therefore
his
most
base
desires
and
wildest
passions
overwhelm
him
and
he
becomes
driven
by
lust
using
force
and
fraud
to
take
whatever
he
wants
the
tyrant
is
both
slave
to
his
lusts
and
master
to
whomever
he
can
enslave
because
of
this
tyranny
is
regime
with
least
freedom
and
happiness
and
tyrant
is
most
unhappy
of
all
since
regime
and
soul
correspond
his
desires
are
never
fulfilled
and
he
always
must
live
in
fear
of
his
victims
because
tyrant
can
only
think
in
terms
of
servant
and
master
he
has
no
equals
whom
he
can
befriend
and
with
no
friends
tyrant
is
robbed
of
freedom
this
is
first
proof
that
it
is
better
to
be
just
than
unjust
the
second
proof
is
derived
from
tripartite
theory
of
soul
the
wisdomloving
soul
is
best
equipped
to
judge
what
is
best
through
reason
and
wise
individual
judges
wisdom
to
be
best
then
honor
then
desire
this
is
just
proportion
for
city
or
soul
and
stands
opposite
to
tyranny
which
is
entirely
satiated
on
base
desires
the
third
proof
follows
from
this
he
describes
how
soul
can
be
misled
into
experiencing
false
pleasure
for
example
lack
of
pain
can
seem
pleasurable
by
comparison
to
worse
state
true
pleasure
is
had
by
being
fulfilled
by
things
that
fit
ones
nature
wisdom
is
most
fulfilling
and
is
best
guide
so
only
way
for
three
drives
of
soul
to
function
properly
and
experience
truest
pleasure
is
by
allowing
wisdom
to
lead
to
conclude
third
proof
wisdom
element
is
best
at
providing
pleasure
while
tyranny
is
worst
because
it
is
furthest
removed
from
wisdom
finally
socrates
considers
multiple
of
how
much
worse
tyranny
is
than
kinglydisciplinedwise
temperament
and
even
quantifies
tyrant
as
living
times
more
painfullyless
joyfully
than
king
he
then
gives
example
of
chimera
to
further
illustrate
justice
and
tripartite
soul
the
discussion
concludes
by
refuting
thrasymachus
argument
and
designating
most
blessed
life
as
that
of
just
man
and
most
miserable
life
as
that
of
unjust
man
book
xedit

theme

up
most
explicitly
in

vi
socrates
finally
rejects
any
form
of
imitative
art
and
concludes
that
such
artists
have
no
place
in
just
city
he
continues
on
to
argue
for
immortality
of
psyche
and
even
espouses
theory
of
reincarnation
he
finishes
by
detailing
rewards
of
being
just
both
in
this
life
and
next
artists
create
things
but
they
are
only
different
copies
of
idea
of
original
and
whenever
any
one
informs
us
that
he
has
found
man
who
knows
all
arts
and
all
things
else
that
anybody
knows
and
every
single
thing
with

of

tells
us

who
is
likely
to
have
been
deceived
by
some
wizard
or
actor
whom
he
met
and
whom
he
thought
allknowing
because
he
himself
was
unable
to
analyze
nature
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
and
imitation
and
same
object
appears
straight
when
looked
at
out
of
water
and
crooked
when
in
water
and
concave
becomes
convex
owing
to
illusion
about
colours
to
which
sight
is
liable
thus
every
sort
of
confusion
is
revealed
within
us
and
this
is
that
weakness
of
human
mind
on
which
art
of
conjuring
and
deceiving
by
light
and
shadow
and
other
ingenous
devices
imposes
having
effect
upon
us
like
magic
he
speaks
about
illusions
and
confusion
things
can
look
very
similar
but
be
different
in

because
we
are

at
times
we

definition
of
justiceedit
in
first
book
two
definitions
of
justice
are
proposed
but
deemed
inadequate
returning
debts
owed
and
helping
friends
while
harming
enemies
are
commonsense
definitions
of
justice
that
socrates
shows
are
inadequate
in
exceptional
situations
and
thus
lack
rigidity
demanded
of
definition
yet
he
does
not
completely
reject
them
for
each
expresses
commonsense
notion
of
justice
that
socrates
will
incorporate
into
his
discussion
of
just
regime
in
books
ii
through
v
at
end
of
book
i
socrates
agrees
with
polemarchus
that
justice
includes
helping
friends
but
says
just
man
would
never
do
harm
to
anybody
thrasymachus
believes
that
socrates
has
done
men
present
injustice
by
saying
this
and
attacks
his
character
and
reputation
in
front
of
group
partly
because
he
suspects
that
socrates
himself
does
not
even
believe
harming
enemies
is
unjust
thrasymachus
gives
his
understanding
of
justice
and
injustice
as
justice
is
what
is
advantageous
to
stronger
while
injustice
is
to
ones
own
profit
and
advantage
socrates
finds
this
definition
unclear
and
begins
to
question
thrasymachus
socrates
then
asks
whether
ruler
who
makes
mistake
by
making
law
that
lessens
their
wellbeing
is
still
ruler
according
to
that
definition
thrasymachus
agrees
that
no
true
ruler
would
make
such
error
this
agreement
allows
socrates
to
undermine
thrasymachus
strict
definition
of
justice
by
comparing
rulers
to
people
of
various
professions
thrasymachus
consents
to
socrates
assertion
that
artist
is
someone
who
does
his
job
well
and
is
knower
of
some
art
which
allows
him
to
complete
job
well
in
so
doing
socrates
gets
thrasymachus
to
admit
that
rulers
who
enact
law
that
does
not
benefit
them
firstly
are
in
precise
sense
not
rulers
thrasymachus
gives
up
and
is
silent
from
then
on
socrates
has
trapped
thrasymachus
into
admitting
strong
man
who
makes
mistake
is
not
strong
man
in
precise
sense
and
that
some
type
of
knowledge
is
required
to
rule
perfectly
however
it
is
far
from
satisfactory
definition
of
justice
at
beginning
of
book
ii
platos
two
brothers
challenge
socrates
to
define
justice
in
man
and
unlike
rather
short
and
simple
definitions
offered
in
book
i
their
views
of
justice
are
presented
in
two
independent
speeches
glaucons
speech
reprises
thrasymachus
idea
of
justice
it
starts
with
legend
of
gyges
who
discovered
ring
socalled
ring
of
gyges
that
gave
him
power
to
become
invisible
glaucon
uses
this
story
to
argue
that
no
man
would
be
just
if
he
had
opportunity
of
doing
injustice
with
impunity
with
power
to
become
invisible
gyges
is
able
to
seduce
queen
murder
king
and
take
over
kingdom
glaucon
argues
that
just
as
well
as
unjust
man
would
do
same
if
they
had
power
to
get
away
with
injustice
exempt
from
punishment
the
only
reason
that
men
are
just
and
praise
justice
is
out
of
fear
of
being
punished
for
injustice
the
law
is
product
of
compromise
between
individuals
who
agree
not
to
do
injustice
to
others
if
others
will
not
do
injustice
to
them
glaucon
says
that
if
people
had
power
to
do
injustice
without
fear
of
punishment
they
would
not
enter
into
such
agreement
glaucon
uses
this
argument
to
challenge
socrates
to
defend
position
that
just
life
is
better
than
unjust
life
adeimantus
adds
to
glaucons
speech
charge
that
men
are
only
just
for
results
that
justice
brings
one
fortune
honor
reputation
adeimantus
challenges
socrates
to
prove
that
being
just
is
worth
something
in
and
of
itself
not
only
as
means
to
end
socrates
says
that
there
is
no
better
topic
to
debate
in
response
to
two
views
of
injustice
and
justice
presented
by
glaucon
and
adeimantus
he
claims
incompetence
but
feels
it
would
be
impious
to
leave
justice
in
such
doubt
thus
republic
sets
out
to
define
justice
given
difficulty
of
this
task
as
proven
in
book
i
socrates
in
book
ii
leads
his
interlocutors
into
discussion
of
justice
in
city
which
socrates
suggests
may
help
them
see
justice
not
only
in
person
but
on
larger
scale
first
in
cities
searching
for
what
it
is
then
thusly
we
could
examine
also
in
some
individual
examining
likeness
of
bigger
in
idea
of
littler
ea
for
over
two
and
half
millennia
scholars
have
differed
on
aptness
of
citysoul
analogy
socrates
uses
to
find
justice
in
books
ii
through
v
the
republic
is
dramatic
dialogue
not
treatise
socrates
definition
of
justice
is
never
unconditionally
stated
only
versions
of
justice
within
each
city
are
found
and
evaluated
in
books
ii
through
book
v
socrates
constantly
refers
definition
of
justice
back
to
conditions
of
city
for
which
it
is
created
he
builds
series
of
myths
or
noble
lies
to
make
cities
appear
just
and
these
conditions
moderate
life
within
communities
the
earth
born
myth
makes
all
men
believe
that
they
are
born
from
earth
and
have
predestined
natures
within
their
veins
accordingly
socrates
defines
justice
as
working
at
that
to
which
he
is
naturally
best
suited
and
to
do
ones
own
business
and
not
to
be
busybody
ab
and
goes
on
to
say
that
justice
sustains
and
perfects
other
three
cardinal
virtues
temperance
wisdom
and
courage
and
that
justice
is
cause
and
condition
of
their
existence
socrates
does
not
include
justice
as
virtue
within
city
suggesting
that
justice
does
not
exist
within
human
soul
either
rather
it
is
result
of
well
ordered
soul
a
result
of
this
conception
of
justice
separates
people
into
three
types
that
of
soldier
that
of
producer
and
that
of
ruler
if
ruler
can
create
just
laws
and
if
warriors
can
carry
out
orders
of
rulers
and
if
producers
can
obey
this
authority
then
society
will
be
just
the
city
is
challenged
by
adeimantus
and
glaucon
throughout
its
development
adeimantus
cannot
find
happiness
in
city
and
glaucon
cannot
find
honor
and
glory
this
hypothetical
city
contains
no
private
property
no
marriage
or
nuclear
families
these
are
sacrificed
for
common
good
and
doing
what
is
best
fitting
to
ones
nature
in
book
v
socrates
addresses
question
of
naturalness
of
and
possibility
for
this
city
concluding
in
book
vi
that
citys
ontological
status
regards
construction
of
soul
not
of
actual
metropolis
the
rule
of
philosopherkings
appear
as
issue
of
possibility
is
raised
socrates
never
positively
states
what
justice
is
in
human
soulcity
it
appears
he
has
created
city
where
justice
is
not
found
but
can
be
lost
it
is
as
though
in
wellordered
state
justice
is
not
even
needed
since
community
satisfies
needs
of
humans
in
terms
of
why
it
is
best
to
be
just
rather
than
unjust
for
individual
plato
prepares
answer
in
book
ix
consisting
of
three
main
arguments
plato
says
that
tyrants
nature
will
leave
him
with
horrid
pains
and
pangs
and
that
typical
tyrant
engages
in
lifestyle
that
will
be
physically
and
mentally
exacting
on
such
ruler
such
disposition
is
in
contrast
to
truthloving
philosopherking
and
tyrant
never
tastes
of
true
freedom
or
friendship
the
second
argument
proposes
that
of
all
different
types
of
people
only
philosopher
is
able
to
judge
which
type
of
ruler
is
best
since
only
he
can
see
form
of
good
thirdly
plato
argues
pleasures
which
are
approved
of
by
lover
of
wisdom
and
reason
are
truest
in
sum
plato
argues
that
philosophical
pleasure
is
only
true
pleasure
since
other
pleasures
experienced
by
others
are
simply
neutral
state
free
of
pain
socrates
points
out
human
tendency
to
be
corrupted
by
power
leads
down
road
to
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
from
this
he
concludes
that
ruling
should
be
left
to
philosophers
who
are
most
just
and
therefore
least
susceptible
to
corruption
this
good
city
is
depicted
as
being
governed
by
philosopherkings
disinterested
persons
who
rule
not
for
their
personal
enjoyment
but
for
good
of
citystate
polis
the
philosophers
have
seen
forms
and
therefore
know
what
is
good
they
understand
corrupting
effect
of
greed
and
own
no
property
and
receive
no
salary
they
also
live
in
sober
communism
eating
and
sleeping
together
the
paradigmatic
society
which
stands
behind
every
historical
society
is
hierarchical
but
social
classes
have
marginal
permeability
there
are
no
slaves
no
discrimination
between
men
and
women
the
men
and
women
are
both
to
be
taught
same
things
so
they
are
both
able
to
be
used
for
same
things
e
in
addition
to
ruling
class
of
guardians
which
abolished
riches
there
is
class
of
private
producers
demiourgoi
who
may
be
rich
or
poor
a
number
of
provisions
aim
to
avoid
making
people
weak
substitution
of
universal
educational
system
for
men
and
women
instead
of
debilitating
music
poetry
and
theatre
startling
departure
from
greek
society
these
provisions
apply
to
all
classes
and
restrictions
placed
on
philosopherkings
chosen
from
warrior
class
and
warriors
are
much
more
severe
than
those
placed
on
producers
because
rulers
must
be
kept
away
from
any
source
of
corruption
in
books
vvi
abolition
of
riches
among
guardian
class
not
unlike
max
webers
bureaucracy
leads
controversially
to
abandonment
of
typical
family
and
as
such
no
child
may
know
his
or
her
parents
and
parents
may
not
know
their
own
children
socrates
tells
tale
which
is
allegory
of
good
government
the
rulers
assemble
couples
for
reproduction
based
on
breeding
criteria
thus
stable
population
is
achieved
through
eugenics
and
social
cohesion
is
projected
to
be
high
because
familial
links
are
extended
towards
everyone
in
city
also
education
of
youth
is
such
that
they
are
taught
of
only
works
of
writing
that
encourage
them
to
improve
themselves
for
states
good
and
envision
gods
as
entirely
good
just
and
authors
of
only
that
which
is
good
in
books
viix
stand
platos
criticism
of
forms
of
government
it
begins
with
dismissal
of
timocracy
sort
of
authoritarian
regime
not
unlike
military
dictatorship
plato
offers
almost
psychoanalytical
explanation
of
timocrat
as
one
who
saw
his
father
humiliated
by
his
mother
and
wants
to
vindicate
manliness
the
third
worst
regime
is
oligarchy
rule
of
small
band
of
rich
people
millionaires
that
only
respect
money
then
comes
democratic
form
of
government
and
its
susceptibility
to
being
ruled
by
unfit
sectarian
demagogues
finally
worst
regime
is
tyranny
where
whimsical
desires
of
ruler
became
law
and
there
is
no
check
upon
arbitrariness

problem

universals
allegory
of
cave
and
theory
of
forms
the
republic
contains
platos
allegory
of
cave
with
which
he
explains
his
concept
of
forms
as
answer
to
problem
of
universals
the
allegory
of
cave
primarily
depicts
platos
distinction
between
world
of
appearances
and
real
world
of
forms
as
well
as
helping
to
justify
philosophers
place
in
society
as
king
plato
imagines
group
of
people
who
have
lived
their
entire
lives
as
prisoners
chained
to
wall
of
cave
in
subterranean
so
they
are
unable
to
see
outside
world
behind
them
however
constant
flame
illuminates
various
moving
objects
outside
which
are
silhouetted
on
wall
of
cave
visible
to
prisoners
these
prisoners
through
having
no
other
experience
of
reality
ascribe
forms
to
these
shadows
such
as
either
dog
or
cat
plato
then
goes
on
to
explain
how
philosopher
is
akin
to
prisoner
who
is
freed
from
cave
the
prisoner
is
initially
blinded
by
light
but
when
he
adjusts
to
brightness
he
sees
fire
and
statues
and
how
they
caused
images
witnessed
inside
cave
he
sees
that
fire
and
statues
in
cave
were
just
copies
of
real
objects
merely
imitations
this
is
analogous
to
forms
what
we
see
from
day
to
day
are
merely
appearances
reflections
of
forms
the
philosopher
however
will
not
be
deceived
by
shadows
and
will
hence
be
able
to
see
real
world
world
above
that
of
appearances
philosopher
will
gain
knowledge
of
things
in
themselves
in
this
analogy
sun
is
representative
of
good
this
is
main
object
of
philosophers
knowledge
the
good
can
be
thought
of
as
form
of
forms
or
structuring
of
world
as
whole
the
prisoners
stages
of
understanding
correlate
with
levels
on
divided
line
which
he

also
called

timocracy
socrates
defines
timocracy
as
government
of
people
who
love

and
honor
socrates
argues
that
timocracy
emerges
from

due
to

breaking
out
among

class
and
majority
over

many

guardian
qualities
slowly
drawing

away
from

this

will
continue

that

to

be
directed

his

thus
creating

for
criminals

emerge
the
rich
are
constantly
plotting
against

and
vice

the
oligarchic
constitution
is
based
on
property
assessment
and
wealth
qualification
unlike
timocracy
oligarchs
are
also
unable
to
fight
war
since
they
do
not
wish
to

for
fear
of
their
rising
up

some
of

led

to
ask
readers
to
consider
possibility
that
socrates
was
creating
not

for

learning

are
many
points
in

that

which
raise

is
employing

to
make

themselves
ultimate
value
of
proposals
in
turn
plato
has
immortalized
this
learning
exercise
in
republic
one
of
many
examples
is
that
socrates
calls
marriages
of
ruling
class
sacred
however
they

only

are

of
manipulating
and

strauss
and

interpretations
however
involve
more
than
just
pointing
out
inconsistencies
by
calling
attention
to
these
issues
they
ask
readers
to
think
more
deeply
about
whether
plato
is
being
ironic
or
genuine
for
neither
strauss
nor
bloom
present
unequivocal
opinion
preferring
to
raise
philosophic
doubt
over
interpretive
fact
strausss
approach
developed
out
of
belief
that
plato
wrote
esoterically
the
basic
acceptance
of
exotericesoteric
distinction
revolves
around
whether
plato
really
wanted
to
see
just
city
in
speech
of
books
vvi
come
to
pass
or
whether
it
is
just
allegory
strauss
never
regarded
this
as
crucial
issue
of
dialogue
he
argued
against
karl
poppers
literal
view
citing
ciceros
opinion
that
republics
true
nature
was
to
bring
to
light
nature
of
political
things
in
fact
strauss
undermines
justice
found
in
just
city
in
speech
by
implying
city
is
not
natural
it
is
manmade
conceit
that
abstracts
away
from
erotic
needs
of
body
the
city
founded
in
republic
is
rendered
possible
by
abstraction
from
eros
an
argument
that
has
been
used
against
ascribing
ironic
intent
to
plato
is
that
platos
academy
produced
number
of
tyrants
who
seized
political
power
and
abandoned
philosophy
for
ruling
city
despite
being
wellversed
in
greek
and
having
direct
contact
with
plato
himself
some
of
platos
former
students
like
clearchus
tyrant
of
heraclea
chaeron
tyrant
of
pellene
erastus
and
coriscus
tyrants
of
skepsis
hermias
of
atarneus
and
assos
and
calippus
tyrant
of
syracuse
ruled
people
and
did
not
impose
anything
like
philosopherkingship
however
it
can
be
argued
whether
these
men
became
tyrants
through
studying
in
academy
platos
school
had
elite
student
body
some
of
whom
would
by
birth
and
family
expectation
end
up
in
seats
of
power
additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
that
these
men
were
tyrants
in
modern
totalitarian
sense
of
concept
finally
since
very
little
is
actually
known
about
what
was
taught
at
platos
academy
there
is
no
small
controversy
over
whether
it
was
even
in
business
of
teaching
politics
at
all
views
on
citysoul
analogyedit
many
critics
both
ancient
and
modern
like
julia
annas
have
suggested
that
dialogues
political
discussion
actually
serves
as
analogy
for
individual
soul
in
which
there
are
also
many
different
members
that
can
either
conflict
or
else
be
integrated
and
orchestrated
under
just
and
productive
government
among
other
things
this
analogical
reading
would
solve
problem
of
certain
implausible
statements
plato
makes
concerning
ideal
political
republic
norbert
blssner
argues
that
republic
is
best
understood
as
analysis
of
workings
and
moral
improvement
of
individual
soul
with
remarkable
thoroughness
and
clarity
this
view
of
course
does
not
preclude
legitimate
reading
of
republic
as
political
treatise
work
could
operate
at
both
levels
it
merely
implies
that
it
deserves
more
attention
as
work
on
psychology
and
moral
philosophy
than
it
has
sometimes
received
practicalityedit
the
abovementioned
views
have
in
common
that
they
view
republic
as
theoretical
work
not
as
set
of
guidelines
for
good
governance
however
popper
insists
that
republic
was
meant
by
its
author
not
so
much
as
theoretical
treatise
but
as
topical
political
manifesto
and
bertrand
russell
argues
that
at

in
intent
and
all
in
all
not
so
far
from
what
was
possible
in
ancient
greek
citystates
form
of
government
portrayed
in
republic
was
meant
as
practical
one
by
plato
st
centuryedit
one
of
platos
recurring
techniques
in
republic
is
to
refine
concept
of
justice
with
reference
to
various
examples
of
greater
or
lesser
injustice
however
in
the
concept
of
injustice
eric
heinze
challenges
assumption
that
justice
and
injustice
form
mutually
exclusive
pair
heinze
argues
that
such
assumption
traces
not
from
strict
deductive
logic
but
from
arbitrary
etymology
of
word
injustice
heinze
critiques
what
he
calls
classical
western
justice
theory
for
having
perpetuated
that
logical
error
which
first
appears
in
platos
republic
but
manifests
throughout
traditional
political
philosophy
in
thinkers
otherwise
as
different
as
aristotle
aquinas
locke
rousseau
hegel
and
marx
in
survey
of
over
academics
and
students
voted
republic
greatest
philosophical
text
ever
written
julian
baggini
argued
that
although
work
was
wrong
on
almost
every
point
questions
it
raises
and
methods
it
uses
are
essential
to
western
tradition
of
philosophy
without
it
we
might
not
have
philosophy
as
we
know
it
in
fiction
jo
waltons
novel
the
just
city
explored
consequences
of
establishing
citystate
based
on
republic
in
practice
place
in
platos
corpusedit
the
republic
is
generally
placed
in
middle
period
of
platos
dialoguesthat
is
it
is
believed
to
be
written
after
early
period
dialogues
but
before
late
period
dialogues
however
distinction
of
this
group
from
early
dialogues
is
not
as
clear
as
distinction
of
late
dialogues
from
all
others
nonetheless
ritter
arnim
and
baronwith
their
separate
methodologiesall
agreed
that
republic
was
well
distinguished
along
with
parmenides
phaedrus
and
theaetetus
however
first
book
of
republic
which
shares
many
features
with
earlier
dialogues
is
thought
to
have
originally
been
written
as
separate
work
and
then
remaining
books
were
conjoined
to
it
perhaps
with
modifications
to
original
of
first
book
fragmentsedit
several
oxyrhynchus
papyri
fragments
were
found
to
contain
parts
of
republic
and
from
other
works
such
as
phaedo
or
dialogue
gorgias
written
around
ce
fragments
of
different
version
of
platos
republic
were
discovered
in
part
of
nag
hammadi
library
written
ca
ce
these
findings

influence
of

a

book
iedit
in
first
book
aristotle
discusses
city
polis
or
political
community
koinnia
politik
as
opposed
to
other
types
of
communities
and
partnerships
such
as
household
oikos
and
village
the
highest
form
of
community
is
polis
aristotle
comes
to
this
conclusion
because
he
believes
public
life
is
far
more
virtuous
than
private
and
because
men
are
political
animals
he
begins
with
relationship
between
city
and
man
i
and
then
specifically
discusses
household
oikos
i
he
takes
issue
with
view
that
political
rule
kingly
rule
rule
over
slaves
and
rule
over
household
or
village
are
only
different
in
size
he
then
examines
in
what
way
city
may
be
said
to
be
natural
aristotle
discusses
parts
of
household
oikos
which
includes
slaves
leading
to
discussion
of
whether
slavery
can
ever
be
just
and
better
for
person
enslaved
or
is
always
unjust
and
bad
he
distinguishes
between
those
who
are
slaves
because
law
says
they
are
and
those
who
are
slaves
by
nature
saying
inquiry
hinges
on
whether
there
are
any
such
natural
slaves
only
someone
as
different
from
other
people
as
body
is
from
soul
or
beasts
are
from
human
beings
would
be
slave
by
nature
aristotle
concludes
all
others
being
slaves
solely
by
law
or
convention
some
scholars
have
therefore
concluded
that
qualifications
for
natural
slavery
preclude
existence
of
such
being
aristotle
then
moves
to
question
of
property
in
general
arguing
that
acquisition
of
property
does
not
form
part
of
household
management
oikonomike
and
criticizing
those
who
take
it
too
seriously
it
is
necessary
but
that
does
not
make
it
part
of
household
management
any
more
than
it
makes
medicine
part
of
household
management
just
because
health
is
necessary
he
criticizes
income
based
upon
trade
and
upon
interest
saying
that
those
who
become
avaricious
do
so
because
they
forget
that
money
merely
symbolizes
wealth
without
being
wealth
and
contrary
to
nature
on
interest
because
it
increases
by
itself
not
through
exchange
book
i
concludes
with
aristotles
assertion
that
proper
object
of
household
rule
is
virtuous
character
of
ones
wife
and
children
not
management
of
slaves
or
acquisition
of
property
rule
over
slaves
is
despotic
rule
over
children
kingly
and
rule
over
ones
wife
political
except
there
is
no
rotation
in
office
aristotle
questions
whether
it
is
sensible
to
speak
of
virtue
of
slave
and
whether
virtues
of
wife
and
children
are
same
as
those
of
man
before
saying
that
because
city
must
be
concerned
that
its
women
and
children
be
virtuous
virtues
that
father
should
instill
are
dependent
upon
regime
and
so
discussion
must
turn
to
what
has
been
said
about
best
regime
book
iiedit
book
ii
examines
various
views
concerning
best
regime
it
opens
with
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
platos
republic
holding
that
communal
share
of
property
between
guardians
will
increase
rather
than
decrease
dissensions
and
sharing
of
wives
and
children
will
destroy
natural
affection
he
concludes
that
common
sense
is
against
this
arrangement
for
good
reason
and
claims
that
experiment
shows
it
to
be
impractical
next
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
platos
laws
aristotle
then
discusses
systems
presented
by
two
other
philosophers
phaleas
of
chalcedon
and
hippodamus
of
miletus
after
addressing
regimes
invented
by
theorists
aristotle
moves
to
examination
of
three
regimes
that
are
commonly
held
to
be
well
managed
these
are
spartan
cretan
and
carthaginian
the
book
concludes
with
some
observations
on
regimes
and
legislators
book
iiiedit
who
can
be
citizen
he
who
has
power
to
take
part
in
deliberative
or
judicial
administration
of
any
state
is
said
by
us
to
be
citizen
of
that
state
and
speaking
generally
state
is
body
of
citizens
sufficing
for
purpose
of
life
but
in
practice
citizen
is
defined
to
be
one
of
whom
both
parents
are
citizens
others
insist
on
going
further
back
say
two
or
three
or
more
grandparents
aristotle
asserts
that
citizen
is
anyone
who
can
take
part
in
governmental
process
he
finds
that
most
people
in
polis
are
capable
of
being
citizens
this
is

platonist
view

according

are

aristotles
sixfold
classification
is
slightly
different
from
one
found
in
the
statesman
by
plato
the
diagram
above
illustrates
aristotles
classification
moreover
following
platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
it
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
this
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as
oligarchy
aristotle
politics
book
b
to
illustrate
this
approach
aristotle
proposed
firstofitskind
mathematical
model
of
voting
albeit
textually
described
where

principle
of
one
voterone

combined

see
tangian
compositionedit
the
literary
character
of
politics
is
subject
to
some
dispute
growing
out
of
textual
difficulties
that
attended
loss
of
aristotles
works
book
iii
ends
with
sentence
that
is
repeated
almost
verbatim
at
start
of
book
vii
while
intervening
books
ivvi
seem
to
have
different
flavor
from
rest
book
iv
seems
to
refer
several
times
back
to
discussion
of
best
regime
contained
in
books
viiviii
some
editors
have
therefore
inserted
books
viiviii
after
book
iii
at
same
time
however
references
to
discourses
on
politics
that
occur
in
nicomachean
ethics
suggest
that
treatise
as
whole
ought
to
conclude
with
discussion
of
education
that
occurs
in
book
viii
of
politics
although
it
is
not
certain
that
aristotle
is
referring
to
politics
here
werner
jaeger
suggested
that
politics
actually
represents
conflation
of
two
distinct
treatises
the
first
books
iiii
viiviii
would
represent
less
mature
work
from
when
aristotle
had
not
yet
fully
broken
from
plato
and
consequently
show
greater
emphasis
on
best
regime
the
second
books
ivvi
would
be
more
empirically
minded
and
thus
belong
to
later
stage
of
development
carnes
lord
scholar
on
aristotle
has
argued
against
sufficiency
of
this
view
however
noting
numerous
crossreferences
between
jaegers
supposedly
separate
works
and
questioning
difference
in
tone
that
jaeger
saw
between
them
for
example
book
iv
explicitly
notes
utility
of
examining
actual
regimes
jaegers
empirical
focus
in
determining
best
regime
jaegers
platonic
focus
instead
lord
suggests
that
politics
is
indeed
finished
treatise
and
that
books
vii
and
viii
do
belong
in
between
books
iii
and
iv
he
attributes
their
current
ordering
to
merely
mechanical
transcription
error
it
is
uncertain
if
politics
was
translated
into
arabic
like
most
of
his
major
works
its
influence
and
ideas
were
however
carried
over
to
arabic
philosophers

a

book
iedit
in
first
book
aristotle
discusses
city
polis
or
political
community
koinnia
politik
as
opposed
to
other
types
of
communities
and
partnerships
such
as
household
oikos
and
village
the
highest
form
of
community
is
polis
aristotle
comes
to
this
conclusion
because
he
believes
public
life
is
far
more
virtuous
than
private
and
because
men
are
political
animals
he
begins
with
relationship
between
city
and
man
i
and
then
specifically
discusses
household
oikos
i
he
takes
issue
with
view
that
political
rule
kingly
rule
rule
over
slaves
and
rule
over
household
or
village
are
only
different
in
size
he
then
examines
in
what
way
city
may
be
said
to
be
natural
aristotle
discusses
parts
of
household
oikos
which
includes
slaves
leading
to
discussion
of
whether
slavery
can
ever
be
just
and
better
for
person
enslaved
or
is
always
unjust
and
bad
he
distinguishes
between
those
who
are
slaves
because
law
says
they
are
and
those
who
are
slaves
by
nature
saying
inquiry
hinges
on
whether
there
are
any
such
natural
slaves
only
someone
as
different
from
other
people
as
body
is
from
soul
or
beasts
are
from
human
beings
would
be
slave
by
nature
aristotle
concludes
all
others
being
slaves
solely
by
law
or
convention
some
scholars
have
therefore
concluded
that
qualifications
for
natural
slavery
preclude
existence
of
such
being
aristotle
then
moves
to
question
of
property
in
general
arguing
that
acquisition
of
property
does
not
form
part
of
household
management
oikonomike
and
criticizing
those
who
take
it
too
seriously
it
is
necessary
but
that
does
not
make
it
part
of
household
management
any
more
than
it
makes
medicine
part
of
household
management
just
because
health
is
necessary
he
criticizes
income
based
upon
trade
and
upon
interest
saying
that
those
who
become
avaricious
do
so
because
they
forget
that
money
merely
symbolizes
wealth
without
being
wealth
and
contrary
to
nature
on
interest
because
it
increases
by
itself
not
through
exchange
book
i
concludes
with
aristotles
assertion
that
proper
object
of
household
rule
is
virtuous
character
of
ones
wife
and
children
not
management
of
slaves
or
acquisition
of
property
rule
over
slaves
is
despotic
rule
over
children
kingly
and
rule
over
ones
wife
political
except
there
is
no
rotation
in
office
aristotle
questions
whether
it
is
sensible
to
speak
of
virtue
of
slave
and
whether
virtues
of
wife
and
children
are
same
as
those
of
man
before
saying
that
because
city
must
be
concerned
that
its
women
and
children
be
virtuous
virtues
that
father
should
instill
are
dependent
upon
regime
and
so
discussion
must
turn
to
what
has
been
said
about
best
regime
book
iiedit
book
ii
examines
various
views
concerning
best
regime
it
opens
with
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
platos
republic
holding
that
communal
share
of
property
between
guardians
will
increase
rather
than
decrease
dissensions
and
sharing
of
wives
and
children
will
destroy
natural
affection
he
concludes
that
common
sense
is
against
this
arrangement
for
good
reason
and
claims
that
experiment
shows
it
to
be
impractical
next
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
platos
laws
aristotle
then
discusses
systems
presented
by
two
other
philosophers
phaleas
of
chalcedon
and
hippodamus
of
miletus
after
addressing
regimes
invented
by
theorists
aristotle
moves
to
examination
of
three
regimes
that
are
commonly
held
to
be
well
managed
these
are
spartan
cretan
and
carthaginian
the
book
concludes
with
some
observations
on
regimes
and
legislators
book
iiiedit
who
can
be
citizen
he
who
has
power
to
take
part
in
deliberative
or
judicial
administration
of
any
state
is
said
by
us
to
be
citizen
of
that
state
and
speaking
generally
state
is
body
of
citizens
sufficing
for
purpose
of
life
but
in
practice
citizen
is
defined
to
be
one
of
whom
both
parents
are
citizens
others
insist
on
going
further
back
say
two
or
three
or
more
grandparents
aristotle
asserts
that
citizen
is
anyone
who
can
take
part
in
governmental
process
he
finds
that
most
people
in
polis
are
capable
of
being
citizens
this
is
contrary

platonist
view

according

criteria
on

or

which
are

sixfold
classification
is
slightly
different
from
one
found
in
the
statesman
by
plato
the
diagram
above
illustrates
aristotles
classification
moreover
following
platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
it
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
this
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as
oligarchy
aristotle
politics
book
b
to
illustrate
this
approach
aristotle
proposed
firstofitskind
mathematical
model
of
voting
albeit
textually
described
where

principle

one

see
tangian
compositionedit
the
literary
character
of
politics
is
subject
to
some
dispute
growing
out
of
textual
difficulties
that
attended
loss
of
aristotles
works
book
iii
ends
with
sentence
that
is
repeated
almost
verbatim
at
start
of
book
vii
while
intervening
books
ivvi
seem
to
have
different
flavor
from
rest
book
iv
seems
to
refer
several
times
back
to
discussion
of
best
regime
contained
in
books
viiviii
some
editors
have
therefore
inserted
books
viiviii
after
book
iii
at
same
time
however
references
to
discourses
on
politics
that
occur
in
nicomachean
ethics
suggest
that
treatise
as
whole
ought
to
conclude
with
discussion
of
education
that
occurs
in
book
viii
of
politics
although
it
is
not
certain
that
aristotle
is
referring
to
politics
here
werner
jaeger
suggested
that
politics
actually
represents
conflation
of
two
distinct
treatises
the
first
books
iiii
viiviii
would
represent
less
mature
work
from
when
aristotle
had
not
yet
fully
broken
from
plato
and
consequently
show
greater
emphasis
on
best
regime
the
second
books
ivvi
would
be
more
empirically
minded
and
thus
belong
to
later
stage
of
development
carnes
lord
scholar
on
aristotle
has
argued
against
sufficiency
of
this
view
however
noting
numerous
crossreferences
between
jaegers
supposedly
separate
works
and
questioning
difference
in
tone
that
jaeger
saw
between
them
for
example
book
iv
explicitly
notes
utility
of
examining
actual
regimes
jaegers
empirical
focus
in
determining
best
regime
jaegers
platonic
focus
instead
lord
suggests
that
politics
is
indeed
finished
treatise
and
that
books
vii
and
viii
do
belong
in
between
books
iii
and
iv
he
attributes
their
current
ordering
to
merely
mechanical
transcription
error
it
is
uncertain
if
politics
was
translated
into
arabic
like
most
of
his
major
works
its
influence
and
ideas
were
however
carried
over
to
arabic
philosophers
