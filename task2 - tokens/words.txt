or
Political
Treatise
is
political
paper
by
Baruch
Spinoza
written
in
and
published
posthumously

subtitle

Summaryedit
The
Political
Treatise
has
eleven
Chapters
I
Introduction
II
Of
Natural
law
referring
to
his
TheologicoPolitical
Treatise
III
Of
Right
of
Supreme
Authorities
IV
Of
Function
of
Supreme
Authorities
V
Of
best
State
of
Dominion
VI
to
VII
Of
Monarchy
VIII
to
X
Of
Aristocracy
XI
Of
Democracy
As
in
Aristotles
Politics
Spinoza
analyzes
each
form
of
government
monarchy
aristocracy
and
democracy
without
affirming
which
of
these
is
best
Unlike
Aristotle
Spinoza
argued
on
democracy
at
last
Chapter
not
as
rule
of
majority
but
freedom
for
all
by
natural
law
Although
he
affirms
that
women
are
not
equal
to
men
in
ability
and
addresses
danger
of
Amazons
he
suggests
commonwealth
could
possibly
be
governed
by
both
sexes
This
paper
characterises
notion
of
peace
in
Chapter
V
section
affirming
that
Peace
is
not
mere
absence
of
war
but
is
virtue
that
springs
from
force
of
character
In
same
Chapter
section
Niccol
Machiavelli
is
referred
to
stating
prince
should
establish
and
maintain
dominion
but
with
what
design
can
hardly
be
sure

Plato
pleto
PLAYtoe
Greek
Pltn
pronounced
pltn
in
Classical
Attic
or
BC
was
Athenian
philosopher
during
Classical
period
in
Ancient
Greece
founder
of
Platonist
school
of
thought
and
Academy
first
institution
of
higher
learning
in
Western
world
He
is
widely
considered
pivotal
figure
in
history
of
Ancient
Greek
and
Western
philosophy
along
with
his
teacher
Socrates
and
his
most
famous
student
Aristotle
Plato
has
also
often
been
cited
as
one
of
founders
of
Western
religion
and
spirituality
The
socalled
Neoplatonism
of
philosophers
like
Plotinus
and
Porphyry
greatly
influenced
Christianity
through
Church
Fathers
such
as
Augustine
Alfred
North
Whitehead
once
noted
safest
general
characterization
of
European
philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes
to
Plato
Plato
was
innovator
of
written
dialogue
and
dialectic
forms
in
philosophy
Plato
is
also
considered
founder
of
Western
political
philosophy
His
most
famous
contribution
is
theory
of
Forms
known
by
pure
reason
in
which
Plato
presents
solution
to
problem
of
universals
known
as
Platonism
also
ambiguously
called
either
Platonic
realism
or
Platonic
idealism
He
is
also
namesake
of
Platonic
love
and
Platonic
solids
His
own
most
decisive
philosophical
influences
are
usually
thought
to
have
been
along
with
Socrates
preSocratics
Pythagoras
Heraclitus
and
Parmenides
although
few
of
his
predecessors
works
remain
extant
and
much
of
what
we
know
about
these
figures
today
derives
from
Plato
himselfb
Unlike
work
of
nearly
all
of
his
contemporaries
Platos
entire
body
of
work
is
believed
to
have
survived

Biography
Early
life
Main
article
Early
life
of
Plato
Birth
and
family
Diogenes
Laertius
is
principal
source
for
history
of
ancient
Greek
philosophy
Due
to
lack
of
surviving
accounts
little
is
known
about
Platos
early
life
and
education
Plato
belonged
to
aristocratic
and
influential
family
According
to
disputed
tradition
reported
by
doxographer
Diogenes
Lartius
Platos
father
Ariston
traced
his
descent
from
king
of
Athens
Codrus
and
king
of
Messenia
Melanthus
According
to
ancient
Hellenic
tradition
Codrus
was
said
to
have
been
descended
from
mythological
deity
Poseidon
Through
his
mother
Plato
was
related
to
Solon
Platos
mother
was
Perictione
whose
family
boasted
of
relationship
with
famous
Athenian
lawmaker
and
lyric
poet
Solon
one
of
seven
sages
who
repealed
laws
of
Draco
except
for
death
penalty
for
homicide
Perictione
was
sister
of
Charmides
and
niece
of
Critias
both
prominent
figures
of
Thirty
Tyrants
known
as
Thirty
brief
oligarchic
regime
BC
which
followed
on
collapse
of
Athens
at
end
of
Peloponnesian
War
BC
According
to
some
accounts
Ariston
tried
to
force
his
attentions
on
Perictione
but
failed
in
his
purpose
then
god
Apollo
appeared
to
him
in
vision
and
as
result
Ariston
left
Perictione
unmolested
The
exact
time
and
place
of
Platos
birth
are
unknown
Based
on
ancient
sources
most
modern
scholars
believe
that
he
was
born
in
Athens
or
Aeginac
between
and
BC
not
long
after
start
of
Peloponnesian
Ward
The
traditional
date
of
Platos
birth
during
th
or
th
Olympiad
or
BC
is
based
on
dubious
interpretation
of
Diogenes
Lartius
who
says
When
Socrates
was
gone
Plato
joined
Cratylus
Heracleitean
and
Hermogenes
who
philosophized
in
manner
of
Parmenides
Then
at
twentyeight
Hermodorus
says
Plato
went
to
Euclides
in
Megara
However
as
Debra
Nails
argues
text
does
not
state
that
Plato
left
for
Megara
immediately
after
joining
Cratylus
and
Hermogenes
In
his
Seventh
Letter
Plato
notes
that
his
coming
of
age
coincided
with
taking
of
power
by
Thirty
remarking
But
youth
under
age
of
twenty
made
himself
laughingstock
if
he
attempted
to
enter
political
arena
Thus
Nails
dates
Platos
birth
to
According
to
Neanthes
Plato
was
six
years
younger
than
Isocrates
and
therefore
was
born
same
year
prominent
Athenian
statesman
Pericles
died
BC
Jonathan
Barnes
regards
BC
as
year
of
Platos
birth
The
grammarian
Apollodorus
of
Athens
in
his
Chronicles
argues
that
Plato
was
born
in
th
Olympiad
Both
Suda
and
Sir
Thomas
Browne
also
claimed
he
was
born
during
th
Olympiad
Another
legend
related
that
when
Plato
was
infant
bees
settled
on
his
lips
while
he
was
sleeping
augury
of
sweetness
of
style
in
which
he
would
discourse
about
philosophy
Speusippus
was
Platos
nephew
Besides
Plato
himself
Ariston
and
Perictione
had
three
other
children
two
sons
Adeimantus
and
Glaucon
and
daughter
Potone
mother
of
Speusippus
nephew
and
successor
of
Plato
as
head
of
Academy
The
brothers
Adeimantus
and
Glaucon
are
mentioned
in
Republic
as
sons
of
Ariston
and
presumably
brothers
of
Plato
though
some
have
argued
they
were
unclese
In
scenario
in
Memorabilia
Xenophon
confused
issue
by
presenting
Glaucon
much
younger
than
Plato
Ariston
appears
to
have
died
in
Platos
childhood
although
precise
dating
of
his
death
is
difficult
Perictione
then
married
Pyrilampes
her
mothers
brother
who
had
served
many
times
as
ambassador
to
Persian
court
and
was
friend
of
Pericles
leader
of
democratic
faction
in
Athens
Pyrilampes
had
son
from
previous
marriage
Demus
who
was
famous
for
his
beauty
Perictione
gave
birth
to
Pyrilampes
second
son
Antiphon
halfbrother
of
Plato
who
appears
in
Parmenides
In
contrast
to
his
reticence
about
himself
Plato
often
introduced
his
distinguished
relatives
into
his
dialogues
or
referred
to
them
with
some
precision
In
addition
to
Adeimantus
and
Glaucon
in
Republic
Charmides
has
dialogue
named
after
him
and
Critias
speaks
in
both
Charmides
and
Protagoras
These
and
other
references
suggest
considerable
amount
of
family
pride
and
enable
us
to
reconstruct
Platos
family
tree
According
to
Burnet
opening
scene
of
Charmides
is
glorification
of
whole
family
connection
Platos
dialogues
are
not
only
memorial
to
Socrates
but
also
happier
days
of
his
own
family
Name
The
fact
that
philosopher
in
his
maturity
called
himself
Platon
is
indisputable
but
origin
of
this
name
remains
mysterious
Platon
is
nickname
from
adjective
plats
broad
Although
Platon
was
fairly
common
name
instances
are
known
from
Athens
alone
name
does
not
occur
in
Platos
known
family
line
The
sources
of
Diogenes
Lartius
account
for
this
by
claiming
that
his
wrestling
coach
Ariston
of
Argos
dubbed
him
broad
on
account
of
his
chest
and
shoulders
or
that
Plato
derived
his
name
from
breadth
of
his
eloquence
or
his
wide
forehead
While
recalling
moral
lesson
about
frugal
living
Seneca
mentions
meaning
of
Platos
name
His
very
name
was
given
him
because
of
his
broad
chest
Plato
was
wrestler
His
true
name
was
supposedly
Aristocles
meaning
best
reputationf
According
to
Diogenes
Lartius
he
was
named
after
his
grandfather
as
was
common
in
Athenian
society
But
there
is
only
one
inscription
of
Aristocles
early
archon
of
Athens
in
BC
There
is
no
record
of
line
from
Aristocles
to
Platos
father
Ariston
Recently
scholar
has
argued
that
even
name
Aristocles
for
Plato
was
much
later
invention
However
another
scholar
claims
that
there
is
good
reason
for
not
dismissing
idea
that
Aristocles
was
Platos
given
name
as
mere
invention
of
his
biographers
noting
how
prevalent
that
account
is
in
our
sources
Education
Ancient
sources
describe
him
as
bright
though
modest
boy
who
excelled
in
his
studies
Apuleius
informs
us
that
Speusippus
praised
Platos
quickness
of
mind
and
modesty
as
boy
and
first
fruits
of
his
youth
infused
with
hard
work
and
love
of
study
His
father
contributed
all
which
was
necessary
to
give
to
his
son
good
education
and
therefore
Plato
must
have
been
instructed
in
grammar
music
and
gymnastics
by
most
distinguished
teachers
of
his
time
Plato
invokes
Damon
many
times
in
Republic
Plato
was
wrestler
and
Dicaearchus
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
Plato
wrestled
at
Isthmian
games
Plato
had
also
attended
courses
of
philosophy
before
meeting
Socrates
he
first
became
acquainted
with
Cratylus
and
Heraclitean
doctrines
Ambrose
believed
that
Plato
met
Jeremiah
in
Egypt
and
was
influenced
by
his
ideas
Augustine
initially
accepted
this
claim
but
later
rejected
it
arguing
in
The
City
of
God
that
Plato
was
born
hundred
years
after
Jeremiah

Later
life
and
death
Plato
in
his
academy

after
painting
by
Swedish
painter
Carl
Johan
Wahlbom
Plato
may
have
travelled
in
Italy
Sicily
Egypt
and
CyrenePlatos
own
statement
was
that
he
visited
Italy
and
Sicily
at
age
of
forty
and
was
disgusted
by
sensuality
of
life
there
Said
to
have
returned
to
Athens
at
age
of
forty
Plato
founded
one
of
earliest
known
organized
schools
in
Western
Civilization
on
plot
of
land
in
Grove
of
Hecademus
or
Academus
This
land
was
named
after
Academus
Attic
hero
in
Greek
mythology
In
historic
Greek
times
it
was
adorned
with
oriental
plane
and
olive
plantations
The
Academy
was
large
enclosure
of
ground
about
six
stadia
total
of
between
kilometer
and
half
mile
outside
of
Athens
proper
One
story
is
that
name
of
Academy
comes
from
ancient
hero
Academus
still
another
story
is
that
name
came
from
supposed
former
owner
of
plot
of
land
Athenian
citizen
whose
name
was
also
Academus
while
yet
another
account
is
that
it
was
named
after
member
of
army
of
Castor
and
Pollux
Arcadian
named
Echedemus
The
Academy
operated
until
it
was
destroyed
by
Lucius
Cornelius
Sulla
in
BC
Many
intellectuals
were
schooled
in
Academy
most
prominent
one
being
Aristotle
Throughout
his
later
life
Plato
became
entangled
with
politics
of
city
of
Syracuse
According
to
Diogenes
Lartius
Plato
initially
visited
Syracuse
while
it
was
under
rule
of
Dionysius
During
this
first
trip
Dionysiuss
brotherinlaw
Dion
of
Syracuse
became
one
of
Platos
disciples
but
tyrant
himself
turned
against
Plato
Plato
almost
faced
death
but
he
was
sold
into
slaveryg
Anniceris
Cyrenaic
philosopher
subsequently
bought
Platos
freedom
for
twenty
minas
and
sent
him
home
After
Dionysiuss
death
according
to
Platos
Seventh
Letter
Dion
requested
Plato
return
to
Syracuse
to
tutor
Dionysius
II
and
guide
him
to
become
philosopher
king
Dionysius
II
seemed
to
accept
Platos
teachings
but
he
became
suspicious
of
Dion
his
uncle
Dionysius
expelled
Dion
and
kept
Plato
against
his
will
Eventually
Plato
left
Syracuse
Dion
would
return
to
overthrow
Dionysius
and
ruled
Syracuse
for
short
time
before
being
usurped
by
Calippus
fellow
disciple
of
Plato
According
to
Seneca
Plato
died
at
age
of
on
same
day
he
was
born
The
Suda
indicates
that
he
lived
to
years
while
Neanthes
claims
age
of
A
variety
of
sources
have
given
accounts
of
his
death
One
story
based
on
mutilated
manuscript
suggests
Plato
died
in
his
bed
whilst
young
Thracian
girl
played
flute
to
him
Another
tradition
suggests
Plato
died
at
wedding
feast
The
account
is
based
on
Diogenes
Lartiuss
reference
to
account
by
Hermippus
thirdcentury
Alexandrian
According
to
Tertullian
Plato
simply
died
in
his
sleep
Plato
owned
estate
at
Iphistiadae
which
by
will
he
left
to
certain
youth
named
Adeimantus
presumably
younger
relative
as
Plato
had
elder
brother
or
uncle
by
this
name
Influences
Pythagoras
Bust
of
Pythagoras
in
Rome
Although
Socrates
influenced
Plato
directly
as
related
in
dialogues
influence
of
Pythagoras
upon
Plato
or
in
broader
sense
Pythagoreans
such
as
Archytas
also
appears
to
have
been
significant
Aristotle
claimed
that
philosophy
of
Plato
closely
followed
teachings
of
Pythagoreans
and
Cicero
repeats
this
claim
They
say
Plato
learned
all
things
Pythagorean
It
is
probable
that
both
were
influenced
by
Orphism
and
both
believed
in
metempsychosis
transmigration
of
soul
Pythagoras
held
that
all
things
are
number
and
cosmos
comes
from
numerical
principles
He
introduced
concept
of
form
as
distinct
from
matter
and
that
physical
world
is
imitation
of
eternal
mathematical
world
These
ideas
were
very
influential
on
Heraclitus
Parmenides
and
Plato
George
Karamanolis
notes
that
Numenius
accepted
both
Pythagoras
and
Plato
as
two
authorities
one
should
follow
in
philosophy
but
he
regarded
Platos
authority
as
subordinate
to
that
of
Pythagoras
whom
he
considered
to
be
source
of
all
true
philosophyincluding
Platos
own
For
Numenius
it
is
just
that
Plato
wrote
so
many
philosophical
works
whereas
Pythagoras
views
were
originally
passed
on
only
orally
According
to
R
M
Hare
this
influence
consists
of
three
points
The
platonic
Republic
might
be
related
to
idea
of
tightly
organized
community
of
likeminded
thinkers
like
one
established
by
Pythagoras
in
Croton
The
idea
that
mathematics
and
generally
speaking
abstract
thinking
is
secure
basis
for
philosophical
thinking
as
well
as
for
substantial
theses
in
science
and
morals
They
shared
mystical
approach
to
soul
and
its
place
in
material
world
Plato
and
mathematics
Plato
may
have
studied
under
mathematician
Theodorus
of
Cyrene
and
has
dialogue
named
for
and
whose
central
character
is
mathematician
Theaetetus
While
not
mathematician
Plato
was
considered
accomplished
teacher
of
mathematics
Eudoxus
of
Cnidus
greatest
mathematician
in
Classical
Greece
who
contributed
much
of
what
is
found
in
Euclids
Elements
was
taught
by
Archytas
and
Plato
Plato
helped
to
distinguish
between
pure
and
applied
mathematics
by
widening
gap
between
arithmetic
now
called
number
theory
and
logistic
now
called
arithmetich
Assignment
to
elements
in
Keplers
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
In
dialogue
Timaeus
Plato
associated
each
of
four
classical
elements
earth
air
water
and
fire
with
regular
solid
cube
octahedron
icosahedron
and
tetrahedron
respectively
due
to
their
shape
socalled
Platonic
solids
The
fifth
regular
solid
dodecahedron
was
supposed
to
be
element
which
made
up
heavens
Heraclitus
and
Parmenides
The
two
philosophers
Heraclitus
and
Parmenides
following
way
initiated
by
preSocratic
Greek
philosophers
like
Pythagoras
depart
from
mythology
and
begin
metaphysical
tradition
that
strongly
influenced
Plato
and
continues
today
Heraclitus
by
Hendrick
ter
Brugghen
Bust
of
Parmenides
from
Velia
The
surviving
fragments
written
by
Heraclitus
suggest
view
that
all
things
are
continuously
changing
or
becoming
His
image
of
river
with
everchanging
waters
is
well
known
According
to
some
ancient
traditions
like
that
of
Diogenes
Lartius
Plato
received
these
ideas
through
Heraclitus
disciple
Cratylus
who
held
more
radical
view
that
continuous
change
warrants
scepticism
because
we
cannot
define
thing
that
does
not
have
permanent
nature
Parmenides
adopted
altogether
contrary
vision
arguing
for
idea
of
changeless
Being
and
view
that
change
is
illusion
John
Palmer
notes
Parmenides
distinction
among
principal
modes
of
being
and
his
derivation
of
attributes
that
must
belong
to
what
must
be
simply
as
such
qualify
him
to
be
seen
as
founder
of
metaphysics
or
ontology
as
domain
of
inquiry
distinct
from
theology
These
ideas
about
change
and
permanence
or
becoming
and
Being
influenced
Plato
in
formulating
his
theory
of
Forms
Platos
most
selfcritical
dialogue
is
called
Parmenides
featuring
Parmenides
and
his
student
Zeno
who
following
Parmenides
denial
of
change
argued
forcefully
with
his
paradoxes
to
deny
existence
of
motion
Platos
Sophist
dialogue
includes
Eleatic
stranger
follower
of
Parmenides
as
foil
for
his
arguments
against
Parmenides
In
dialogue
Plato
distinguishes
nouns
and
verbs
providing
some
of
earliest
treatment
of
subject
and
predicate
He
also
argues
that
motion
and
rest
both
are
against
followers
of
Parmenides
who
say
rest
is
but
motion
is
not
Socrates
See

Socratic
problem
Bust
of
Socrates
at
Louvre
Plato
was
one
of
devoted
young
followers
of
Socrates
The
precise
relationship
between
Plato
and
Socrates
remains
area
of
contention
among
scholars
Plato
never
speaks
in
his
own
voice
in
his
dialogues
and
speaks
as
Socrates
in
all
but
Laws
In
Second
Letter
it
says
no
writing
of
Plato
exists
or
ever
will
exist
but
those
now
said
to
be
his
are
those
of
Socrates
become
beautiful
and
new
if
Letter
is
Platos
final
qualification
seems
to
call
into
question
dialogues
historical
fidelity
In
any
case
Xenophons
Memorabilia
and
Aristophaness
The
Clouds
seem
to
present
somewhat
different
portrait
of
Socrates
from
one
Plato
paints
The
Socratic
problem
asks
how
to
reconcile
these
various
accounts
Leo
Strauss
notes
that
Socrates
reputation
for
irony
casts
doubt
on
whether
Platos
Socrates
is
expressing
sincere
beliefs
Aristotle
attributes
different
doctrine
with
respect
to
Forms
to
Plato
and
Socrates
Aristotle
suggests
that
Socrates
idea
of
forms
can
be
discovered
through
investigation
of
natural
world
unlike
Platos
Forms
that
exist
beyond
and
outside
ordinary
range
of
human
understanding
In
dialogues
of
Plato
though
Socrates
sometimes
seems
to
support
mystical
side
discussing
reincarnation
and
mystery
religions
this
is
generally
attributed
to
Platoclarification
needed
Regardless
this
view
of
Socrates
cannot
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
as
we
cannot
be
sure
of
differences
between
views
of
Plato
and
Socrates
In
Meno
Plato
refers
to
Eleusinian
Mysteries
telling
Meno
he
would
understand
Socratess
answers
better
if
he
could
stay
for
initiations
next
week
It
is
possible
that
Plato
and
Socrates
took
part
in
Eleusinian
Mysteries
Philosophy
Metaphysics
In
Platos
dialogues
Socrates
and
his
company
of
disputants
had
something
to
say
on
many
subjects
including
several
aspects
of
metaphysics
These
include
religion
and
science
human
nature
love
and
sexuality
More
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
perception
and
reality
nature
and
custom
and
body
and
soul
The
Forms
The
windmill
proof
of
Pythagorean
theorem
found
in
Euclids
Elements
Platonism
and
its
theory
of
Forms
or
theory
of
Ideas
denies
reality
of
material
world
considering
it
only
image
or
copy
of
real
world
The
theory
of
Forms
is
first
introduced
in
Phaedo
dialogue
also
known
as
On
Soul
wherein
Socrates
refutes
pluralism
of
likes
of
Anaxagoras
then
most
popular
response
to
Heraclitus
and
Parmenides
while
giving
Opposites
Argument
in
support
of
Forms
According
to
this
theory
of
Forms
there
are
at
least
two
worlds
apparent
world
of
concrete
objects
grasped
by
senses
which
constantly
changes
and
unchanging
and
unseen
world
of
Forms
or
abstract
objects
grasped
by
pure
reason
which
ground
what
is
apparent
It
can
also
be
said
there
are
three
worlds
with
apparent
world
consisting
of
both
world
of
material
objects
and
of
mental
images
with
third
realm
consisting
of
Forms
Thus
though
there
is
term
Platonic
idealism
this
refers
to
Platonic
Ideas
or
Forms
and
not
to
some
platonic
kind
of
idealism
thcentury
view
which
sees
matter
as
unreal
in
favour
of
mind
For
Plato
though
grasped
by
mind
only
Forms
are
truly
real
Platos
Forms
thus
represent
types
of
things
as
well
as
properties
patterns
and
relations
to
which
we
refer
as
objects
Just
as
individual
tables
chairs
and
cars
refer
to
objects
in
this
world
tableness
chairness
and
carness
as
well
as
e
g
justice
truth
and
beauty
refer
to
objects
in
another
world
One
of
Platos
most
cited
examples
for
Forms
were
truths
of
geometry
such
as
Pythagorean
theorem
In
other
words
Forms
are
universals
given
as
solution
to
problem
of
universals
or
problem
of
One
and
Many
e
g
how
one
predicate
red
can
apply
to
many
red
objects
For
Plato
this
is
because
there
is
one
abstract
object
or
Form
of
red
redness
itself
in
which
several
red
things
participate
As
Platos
solution
is
that
universals
are
Forms
and
that
Forms
are
real
if
anything
is
Platos
philosophy
is
unambiguously
called
Platonic
realism
According
to
Aristotle
Platos
best
known
argument
in
support
of
Forms
was
one
over
many
argument
What
is
justice
Aside
from
being
immutable
timeless
changeless
and
one
over
many
Forms
also
provide
definitions
and
standard
against
which
all
instances
are
measured
In
dialogues
Socrates
regularly
asks
for
meaning
in
sense
of
intensional
definitions
of
general
term
e
g
justice
truth
beauty
and
criticizes
those
who
instead
give
him
particular
extensional
examples
rather
than
quality
shared
by
all
examples
There
is
thus
world
of
perfect
eternal
and
changeless
meanings
of
predicates
Forms
existing
in
realm
of
Being
outside
of
space
and
time
and
imperfect
sensible
world
of
becoming
subjects
somehow
in
state
between
being
and
nothing
that
partakes
of
qualities
of
Forms
and
is
its
instantiation
The
soul
Plato
advocates
belief
in
immortality
of
soul
and
several
dialogues
end
with
long
speeches
imagining
afterlife
In
Timaeus
Socrates
locates
parts
of
soul
within
human
body
Reason
is
located
in
head
spirit
in
top
third
of
torso
and
appetite
in
middle
third
of
torso
down
to
navel
Epistemology
Socrates
such
as
wisdom
also
discuss
several
aspects
of
epistemology
More
than
one
dialogue
contrasts
knowledge
and
opinion
Platos
epistemology
involves
Socrates
arguing
that
knowledge
is
not
empirical
and
that
it
comes
from
divine
insight
The
Forms
are
also
responsible
for
both
knowledge
or
certainty
and
are
grasped
by
pure
reason
In
several
dialogues
Socrates
inverts
common
mans
intuition
about
what
is
knowable
and
what
is
real
Reality
is
unavailable
to
those
who
use
their
senses
Socrates
says
that
he
who
sees
with
his
eyes
is
blind
While
most
people
take
objects
of
their
senses
to
be
real
if
anything
is
Socrates
is
contemptuous
of
people
who
think
that
something
has
to
be
graspable
in
hands
to
be
real
In
Theaetetus
he
says
such
people
are
eu
amousoi
expression
that
means
literally
happily
without
muses
In
other
words
such
people
are
willingly
ignorant
living
without
divine
inspiration
and
access
to
higher
insights
about
reality
In
Platos
dialogues
Socrates
always
insists
on
his
ignorance
and
humility
that
he
knows
nothing
so
called
Socratic
irony
Several
dialogues
refute
series
of
viewpoints
but
offer
no
positive
position
of
its
own
ending
in
aporia
Recollection
In
several
of
Platos
dialogues
Socrates
promulgates
idea
that
knowledge
is
matter
of
recollection
of
state
before
one
is
born
and
not
of
observation
or
study
Keeping
with
theme
of
admitting
his
own
ignorance
Socrates
regularly
complains
of
his
forgetfulness
In
Meno
Socrates
uses
geometrical
example
to
expound
Platos
view
that
knowledge
in
this
latter
sense
is
acquired
by
recollection
Socrates
elicits
fact
concerning
geometrical
construction
from
slave
boy
who
could
not
have
otherwise
known
fact
due
to
slave
boys
lack
of
education
The
knowledge
must
be
present
Socrates
concludes
in
eternal
nonexperiential
form
In
other
dialogues
Sophist
Statesman
Republic
and
Parmenides
Plato
himself
associates
knowledge
with
apprehension
of
unchanging
Forms
and
their
relationships
to
one
another
which
he
calls
expertise
in
Dialectic
including
through
processes
of
collection
and
division
More
explicitly
Plato
himself
argues
in
Timaeus
that
knowledge
is
always
proportionate
to
realm
from
which
it
is
gained
In
other
words
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
experientially
because
world
of
sense
is
in
flux
views
therein
attained
will
be
mere
opinions
And
opinions
are
characterized
by
lack
of
necessity
and
stability
On
other
hand
if
one
derives
ones
account
of
something
by
way
of
nonsensible
forms
because
these
forms
are
unchanging
so
too
is
account
derived
from
them
That
apprehension
of
forms
is
required
for
knowledge
may
be
taken
to
cohere
with
Platos
theory
in
Theaetetus
and
Meno
Indeed
apprehension
of
Forms
may
be
at
base
of
account
required
for
justification
in
that
it
offers
foundational
knowledge
which
itself
needs
no
account
thereby
avoiding
infinite
regression
Justified
true
belief
A
Venn
diagram
illustrating
classical
theory
of
knowledge
Many
have
interpreted
Plato
as
statingeven
having
been
first
to
writethat
knowledge
is
justified
true
belief
influential
view
that
informed
future
developments
in
epistemology
This
interpretation
is
partly
based
on
reading
of
Theaetetus
wherein
Plato
argues
that
knowledge
is
distinguished
from
mere
true
belief
by
knower
having
account
of
object
of
their
true
belief
And
this
theory
may
again
be
seen
in
Meno
where
it
is
suggested
that
true
belief
can
be
raised
to
level
of
knowledge
if
it
is
bound
with
account
as
to
question
of
why
object
of
true
belief
is
so
Many
years
later
Edmund
Gettier
famously
demonstrated
problems
of
justified
true
belief
account
of
knowledge
That
modern
theory
of
justified
true
belief
as
knowledge
which
Gettier
addresses
is
equivalent
to
Platos
is
accepted
by
some
scholars
but
rejected
by
others
Plato
himself
also
identified
problems
with
justified
true
belief
definition
in
Theaetetus
concluding
that
justification
or
account
would
require
knowledge
of
difference
meaning
that
definition
of
knowledge
is
circular
Ethics
Several
dialogues
discuss
ethics
including
virtue
and
vice
pleasure
and
pain
crime
and
punishment
and
justice
and
medicine
Plato
views
The
Good
as
supreme
Form
somehow
existing
even
beyond
being
Socrates
propounded
moral
intellectualism
which
claimed
nobody
does
bad
on
purpose
and
to
know
what
is
good
results
in
doing
what
is
good
that
knowledge
is
virtue
In
Protagoras
dialogue
it
is
argued
that
virtue
is
innate
and
cannot
be
learned
Socrates
presents
famous
Euthyphro
dilemma
in
dialogue
of
same
name
Is
pious
loved
by
gods
because
it
is
pious
or
is
it
pious
because
it
is
loved
by
gods
a
Justice
As
above
in
Republic
Plato
asks
question
What
is
justice
By
means
of
Greek
term
dikaiosune
term
for
justice
that
captures
both
individual
justice
and
justice
that
informs
societies
Plato
is
able
not
only
to
inform
metaphysics
but
also
ethics
and
politics
with
question
What
is
basis
of
moral
and
social
obligation
Platos
wellknown
answer
rests
upon
fundamental
responsibility
to
seek
wisdom
wisdom
which
leads
to
understanding
of
Form
of
Good
Plato
further
argues
that
such
understanding
of
forms
produces
and
ensures
good
communal
life
when
ideally
structured
under
philosopher
king
in
society
with
three
classes
philosophers
kings
guardians
and
workers
that
neatly
mirror
his
triadic
view
of
individual
soul
reason
spirit
and
appetite
In
this
manner
justice
is
obtained
when
knowledge
of
how
to
fulfill
ones
moral
and
political
function
in
society
is
put
into
practice
Politics
Oxyrhynchus
Papyri
with
fragment
of
Platos
Republic
The
dialogues
also
discuss
politics
Some
of
Platos
most
famous
doctrines
are
contained
in
Republic
as
well
as
in
Laws
and
Statesman
Because
these
doctrines
are
not
spoken
directly
by
Plato
and
vary
between
dialogues
they
cannot
be
straightforwardly
assumed
as
representing
Platos
own
views
Socrates
asserts
that
societies
have
tripartite
class
structure
corresponding
to
appetitespiritreason
structure
of
individual
soul
The
appetitespiritreason
are
analogous
to
castes
of
society
Productive
Workers
labourers
carpenters
plumbers
masons
merchants
farmers
ranchers
etc
These
correspond
to
appetite
part
of
soul
Protective
Warriors
or
Guardians
those
who
are
adventurous
strong
and
brave
in
armed
forces
These
correspond
to
spirit
part
of
soul
Governing
Rulers
or
Philosopher
Kings
those
who
are
intelligent
rational
selfcontrolled
in
love
with
wisdom
well
suited
to
make
decisions
for
community
These
correspond
to
reason
part
of
soul
and
are
very
few
According
to
this
model
principles
of
Athenian
democracy
as
it
existed
in
his
day
are
rejected
as
only
few
are
fit
to
rule
Instead
of
rhetoric
and
persuasion
Socrates
says
reason
and
wisdom
should
govern
As
Socrates
puts
it
Until
philosophers
rule
as
kings
or
those
who
are
now
called
kings
and
leading
men
genuinely
and
adequately
philosophize
that
is
until
political
power
and
philosophy
entirely
coincide
while
many
natures
who
at
present
pursue
either
one
exclusively
are
forcibly
prevented
from
doing
so
cities
will
have
no
rest
from
evils
nor
I
think
will
human
race
Socrates
describes
these
philosopher
kings
as
those
who
love
sight
of
truth
and
supports
idea
with
analogy
of
captain
and
his
ship
or
doctor
and
his
medicine
According
to
him
sailing
and
health
are
not
things
that
everyone
is
qualified
to
practice
by
nature
A
large
part
of
Republic
then
addresses
how
educational
system
should
be
set
up
to
produce
these
philosopher
kings
In
addition
ideal
city
is
used
as
image
to
illuminate
state
of
ones
soul
or
will
reason
and
desires
combined
in
human
body
Socrates
is
attempting
to
make
image
of
rightly
ordered
human
and
then
later
goes
on
to
describe
different
kinds
of
humans
that
can
be
observed
from
tyrants
to
lovers
of
money
in
various
kinds
of
cities
The
ideal
city
is
not
promoted
but
only
used
to
magnify
different
kinds
of
individual
humans
and
state
of
their
soul
However
philosopher
king
image
was
used
by
many
after
Plato
to
justify
their
personal
political
beliefs
The
philosophic
soul
according
to
Socrates
has
reason
will
and
desires
united
in
virtuous
harmony
A
philosopher
has
moderate
love
for
wisdom
and
courage
to
act
according
to
wisdom
Wisdom
is
knowledge
about
Good
or
right
relations
between
all
that
exists
Wherein
it
concerns
states
and
rulers
Socrates
asks
which
is
better
bad
democracy
or
country
reigned
by
tyrant
He
argues
that
it
is
better
to
be
ruled
by
bad
tyrant
than
by
bad
democracy
since
here
all
people
are
now
responsible
for
such
actions
rather
than
one
individual
committing
many
bad
deeds
This
is
emphasised
within
Republic
as
Socrates
describes
event
of
mutiny
on
board
ship
Socrates
suggests
ships
crew
to
be
in
line
with
democratic
rule
of
many
and
captain
although
inhibited
through
ailments
tyrant
Socrates
description
of
this
event
is
parallel
to
that
of
democracy
within
state
and
inherent
problems
that
arise
According
to
Socrates
state
made
up
of
different
kinds
of
souls
will
overall
decline
from
aristocracy
rule
by
best
to
timocracy
rule
by
honourable
then
to
oligarchy
rule
by
few
then
to
democracy
rule
by
people
and
finally
to
tyranny
rule
by
one
person
rule
by
tyrant
Aristocracy
in
sense
of
government
politeia
is
advocated
in
Platos
Republic
This
regime
is
ruled
by
philosopher
king
and
thus
is
grounded
on
wisdom
and
reason
The
aristocratic
state
and
man
whose
nature
corresponds
to
it
are
objects
of
Platos
analyses
throughout
much
of
Republic
as
opposed
to
other
four
types
of
statesmen
who
are
discussed
later
in
his
work
In
Book
VIII
Socrates
states
in
order
other
four
imperfect
societies
with
description
of
states
structure
and
individual
character
In
timocracy
ruling
class
is
made
up
primarily
of
those
with
warriorlike
character
Oligarchy
is
made
up
of
society
in
which
wealth
is
criterion
of
merit
and
wealthy
are
in
control
In
democracy
state
bears
resemblance
to
ancient
Athens
with
traits
such
as
equality
of
political
opportunity
and
freedom
for
individual
to
do
as
he
likes
Democracy
then
degenerates
into
tyranny
from
conflict
of
rich
and
poor
It
is
characterized
by
undisciplined
society
existing
in
chaos
where
tyrant
rises
as
popular
champion
leading
to
formation
of
his
private
army
and
growth
of
oppression
Art
and
poetry
Several
dialogues
tackle
questions
about
art
including
rhetoric
and
rhapsody
Socrates
says
that
poetry
is
inspired
by
muses
and
is
not
rational
He
speaks
approvingly
of
this
and
other
forms
of
divine
madness
drunkenness
eroticism
and
dreaming
in
Phaedrus
and
yet
in
Republic
wants
to
outlaw
Homers
great
poetry
and
laughter
as
well
In
Ion
Socrates
gives
no
hint
of
disapproval
of
Homer
that
he
expresses
in
Republic
The
dialogue
Ion
suggests
that
Homers
Iliad
functioned
in
ancient
Greek
world
as
Bible
does
today
in
modern
Christian
world
as
divinely
inspired
literature
that
can
provide
moral
guidance
if
only
it
can
be
properly
interpreted
Unwritten
doctrines
Bust
excavated
at
Villa
of
Papyri
possibly
of
Dionysus
Plato
or
Poseidon
For
long
time
Platos
unwritten
doctrines
had
been
controversial
Many
modern
books
on
Plato
seem
to
diminish
its
importance
nevertheless
first
important
witness
who
mentions
its
existence
is
Aristotle
who
in
his
Physics
writes
It
is
true
indeed
that
account
he
gives
there
ie
in
Timaeus
of
participant
is
different
from
what
he
says
in
his
socalled
unwritten
teachings
The
term
literally
means
unwritten
doctrines
or
unwritten
dogmas
and
it
stands
for
most
fundamental
metaphysical
teaching
of
Plato
which
he
disclosed
only
orally
and
some
say
only
to
his
most
trusted
fellows
and
which
he
may
have
kept
secret
from
public
The
importance
of
unwritten
doctrines
does
not
seem
to
have
been
seriously
questioned
before
th
century
A
reason
for
not
revealing
it
to
everyone
is
partially
discussed
in
Phaedrus
where
Plato
criticizes
written
transmission
of
knowledge
as
faulty
favouring
instead
spoken
logos
he
who
has
knowledge
of
just
and
good
and
beautiful
will
not
when
in
earnest
write
them
in
ink
sowing
them
through
pen
with
words
which
cannot
defend
themselves
by
argument
and
cannot
teach
truth
effectually
The
same
argument
is
repeated
in
Platos
Seventh
Letter
every
serious
man
in
dealing
with
really
serious
subjects
carefully
avoids
writing
In
same
letter
he
writes
I
can
certainly
declare
concerning
all
these
writers
who
claim
to
know
subjects
that
I
seriously
study
there
does
not
exist
nor
will
there
ever
exist
any
treatise
of
mine
dealing
therewith
Such
secrecy
is
necessary
in
order
not
to
expose
them
to
unseemly
and
degrading
treatment
It
is
however
said
that
Plato
once
disclosed
this
knowledge
to
public
in
his
lecture
On
Good
in
which
Good
is
identified
with
One
Unity
fundamental
ontological
principle
The
content
of
this
lecture
has
been
transmitted
by
several
witnesses
Aristoxenus
describes
event
in
following
words
Each
came
expecting
to
learn
something
about
things
that
are
generally
considered
good
for
men
such
as
wealth
good
health
physical
strength
and
altogether
kind
of
wonderful
happiness
But
when
mathematical
demonstrations
came
including
numbers
geometrical
figures
and
astronomy
and
finally
statement
Good
is
One
seemed
to
them
I
imagine
utterly
unexpected
and
strange
hence
some
belittled
matter
while
others
rejected
it
Simplicius
quotes
Alexander
of
Aphrodisias
who
states
that
according
to
Plato
first
principles
of
everything
including
Forms
themselves
are
One
and
Indefinite
Duality
which
he
called
Large
and
Small
and
Simplicius
reports
as
well
that
one
might
also
learn
this
from
Speusippus
and
Xenocrates
and
others
who
were
present
at
Platos
lecture
on
Good
Their
account
is
in
full
agreement
with
Aristotles
description
of
Platos
metaphysical
doctrine
In
Metaphysics
he
writes
Now
since
Forms
are
causes
of
everything
else
he
ie
Plato
supposed
that
their
elements
are
elements
of
all
things
Accordingly
material
principle
is
Great
and
Small
ie
Dyad
and
essence
is
One
since
numbers
are
derived
from
Great
and
Small
by
participation
in
One
From
this
account
it
is
clear
that
he
only
employed
two
causes
that
of
essence
and
material
cause
for
Forms
are
cause
of
essence
in
everything
else
and
One
is
cause
of
it
in
Forms
He
also
tells
us
what
material
substrate
is
of
which
Forms
are
predicated
in
case
of
sensible
things
and
One
in
that
of
Formsthat
it
is
this
duality
Dyad
Great
and
Small
Further
he
assigned
to
these
two
elements
respectively
causation
of
good
and
of
evil
The
most
important
aspect
of
this
interpretation
of
Platos
metaphysics
is
continuity
between
his
teaching
and
Neoplatonic
interpretation
of
Plotinusi
or
Ficinoj
which
has
been
considered
erroneous
by
many
but
may
in
fact
have
been
directly
influenced
by
oral
transmission
of
Platos
doctrine
A
modern
scholar
who
recognized
importance
of
unwritten
doctrine
of
Plato
was
Heinrich
Gomperz
who
described
it
in
his
speech
during
th
International
Congress
of
Philosophy
in
All
sources
related
to
have
been
collected
by
Konrad
Gaiser
and
published
as
Testimonia
Platonica
These
sources
have
subsequently
been
interpreted
by
scholars
from
German
Tbingen
School
of
interpretation

as

Trial
of
Socrates
The
Death
of
Socrates
by
JacquesLouis
David
The
trial
of
Socrates
and
his
death
sentence
is
central
unifying
event
of
Platos
dialogues
It
is
relayed
in
dialogues
Apology
Crito
and
Phaedo
Apology
is
Socrates
defence
speech
and
Crito
and
Phaedo
take
place
in
prison
after
conviction
Apology
is
among
most
frequently
read
of
Platos
works
In
Apology
Socrates
tries
to
dismiss
rumours
that
he
is
sophist
and
defends
himself
against
charges
of
disbelief
in
gods
and
corruption
of
young
Socrates
insists
that
longstanding
slander
will
be
real
cause
of
his
demise
and
says
legal
charges
are
essentially
false
Socrates
famously
denies
being
wise
and
explains
how
his
life
as
philosopher
was
launched
by
Oracle
at
Delphi
He
says
that
his
quest
to
resolve
riddle
of
oracle
put
him
at
odds
with
his
fellow
man
and
that
this
is
reason
he
has
been
mistaken
for
menace
to
citystate
of
Athens
In
Apology
Socrates
is
presented
as
mentioning
Plato
by
name
as
one
of
those
youths
close
enough
to
him
to
have
been
corrupted
if
he
were
in
fact
guilty
of
corrupting
youth
and
questioning
why
their
fathers
and
brothers
did
not
step
forward
to
testify
against
him
if
he
was
indeed
guilty
of
such
crime
Later
Plato
is
mentioned
along
with
Crito
Critobolus
and
Apollodorus
as
offering
to
pay
fine
of
minas
on
Socrates
behalf
in
lieu
of
death
penalty
proposed
by
Meletus

If
Platos
important
dialogues
do
not
refer
to
Socrates
execution
explicitly
they
allude
to
it
or
use
characters
or
themes
that
play
part
in
it
Five
dialogues
foreshadow
trial
In
Theaetetus
and
Euthyphro
Socrates
tells
people
that
he
is
about
to
face

charges
In
Meno
one
of
men
who
brings
legal
charges
against
Socrates
Anytus
warns
him
about
trouble
he
may
get
into
if
he
does
not
stop
criticizing
important
people
In
Gorgias
Socrates
says
that
his
trial
will
be
like
doctor
prosecuted
by
cook
who
asks
jury
of
children
to
choose
between
doctors
bitter
medicine
and
cooks
tasty
treats
In
Republic
Socrates
explains
why
enlightened
man
presumably
himself
will
stumble
in
courtroom
situation
Platos
support
of
aristocracy
and
distrust
of
democracy
is
also
taken
to
be
partly
rooted
in
democracy
having
killed
Socrates
In
Protagoras
Socrates
is
guest
at
home
of
Callias
son
of
Hipponicus
man
whom
Socrates
disparages
in
Apology
as
having
wasted
great
amount
of
money
on
sophists
fees
Two
other
important
dialogues
Symposium
and
Phaedrus
are
linked
to
main
storyline
by
characters
In
Apology
Socrates
says
Aristophanes
slandered
him
in
comic
play
and
blames
him
for
causing
his
bad
reputation
and
ultimately
his
death
In
Symposium
two
of
them
are
drinking
together
with
other
friends
The
character
Phaedrus
is
linked
to
main
story
line
by
character
Phaedrus
is
also
participant
in
Symposium
and
Protagoras
and
by
theme
philosopher
as
divine
emissary
etc
The
Protagoras
is
also
strongly
linked
to
Symposium
by
characters
all
of
formal
speakers
at
Symposium
with
exception
of
Aristophanes
are
present
at
home
of
Callias
in
that
dialogue
Charmides
and
his
guardian
Critias
are
present
for
discussion
in
Protagoras
Examples
of
characters
crossing
between
dialogues
can
be
further
multiplied
The
Protagoras
contains
largest
gathering
of
Socratic
associates
In
dialogues
Plato
is
most
celebrated
and
admired
for
Socrates
is
concerned
with
human
and
political
virtue
has
distinctive
personality
and
friends
and
enemies
who
travel
with
him
from
dialogue
to
dialogue
This
is
not
to
say
that
Socrates
is
consistent
man
who
is
his
friend
in
one
dialogue
may
be
adversary
or
subject
of
his
mockery
in
another
For
example
Socrates
praises
wisdom
of
Euthyphro
many
times
in
Cratylus
but
makes
him
look
like
fool
in
Euthyphro
He
disparages
sophists
generally
and
Prodicus
specifically
in
Apology
whom
he
also
slyly
jabs
in
Cratylus
for
charging
hefty
fee
of
fifty
drachmas
for
course
on
language
and
grammar
However
Socrates
tells
Theaetetus
in
his
namesake
dialogue
that
he
admires
Prodicus
and
has
directed
many
pupils
to
him
Socrates
ideas
are
also
not
consistent
within
or
between
or
among
dialogues
Allegories
Main
article
Allegorical
interpretations
of
Plato
Mythos
and
logos
are
terms
that
evolved
along
classical
Greek
history
In
times
of
Homer
and
Hesiod
th
century
BC
they
were
essentially
synonyms
and
contained
meaning
of
tale
or
history
Later
came
historians
like
Herodotus
and
Thucydides
as
well
as
philosophers
like
Heraclitus
and
Parmenides
and
other
Presocratics
who
introduced
distinction
between
both
terms
mythos
became
more
nonverifiable
account
and
logos
rational
account
It
may
seem
that
Plato
being
disciple
of
Socrates
and
strong
partisan
of
philosophy
based
on
logos
should
have
avoided
use
of
mythtelling
Instead
he
made
abundant
use
of
it
This
fact
has
produced
analytical
and
interpretative
work
in
order
to
clarify
reasons
and
purposes
for
that
use
Plato
in
general
distinguished
between
three
types
of
mythl
First
there
were
false
myths
like
those
based
on
stories
of
gods
subject
to
passions
and
sufferings
because
reason
teaches
that
God
is
perfect
Then
came
myths
based
on
true
reasoning
and
therefore
also
true
Finally
there
were
those
non
verifiable
because
beyond
of
human
reason
but
containing
some
truth
in
them
Regarding
subjects
of
Platos
myths
they
are
of
two
types
those
dealing
with
origin
of
universe
and
those
about
morals
and
origin
and
fate
of
soul
It
is
generally
agreed
that
main
purpose
for
Plato
in
using
myths
was
didactic
He
considered
that
only
few
people
were
capable
or
interested
in
following
reasoned
philosophical
discourse
but
men
in
general
are
attracted
by
stories
and
tales
Consequently
then
he
used
myth
to
convey
conclusions
of
philosophical
reasoning
Some
of
Platos
myths
were
based
in
traditional
ones
others
were
modifications
of
them
and
finally
he
also
invented
altogether
new
myths
Notable
examples
include
story
of
Atlantis
Myth
of
Er
and
Allegory
of
Cave
The
Cave
Platos
Allegory
of
Cave
by
Jan
Saenredam
according
to
Cornelis
van
Haarlem
Albertina
Vienna
The
theory
of
Forms
is
most
famously
captured
in
his
Allegory
of
Cave
and
more
explicitly
in
his
analogy
of
sun
and
divided
line
The
Allegory
of
Cave
is
paradoxical
analogy
wherein
Socrates
argues
that
invisible
world
is
most
intelligible
noeton
and
that
visible
world
horaton
is
least
knowable
and
most
obscure
Socrates
says
in
Republic
that
people
who
take
sunlit
world
of
senses
to
be
good
and
real
are
living
pitifully
in
den
of
evil
and
ignorance
Socrates
admits
that
few
climb
out
of
den
or
cave
of
ignorance
and
those
who
do
not
only
have
terrible
struggle
to
attain
heights
but
when
they
go
back
down
for
visit
or
to
help
other
people
up
they
find
themselves
objects
of
scorn
and
ridicule
According
to
Socrates
physical
objects
and
physical
events
are
shadows
of
their
ideal
or
perfect
forms
and
exist
only
to
extent
that
they
instantiate
perfect
versions
of
themselves
Just
as
shadows
are
temporary
inconsequential
epiphenomena
produced
by
physical
objects
physical
objects
are
themselves
fleeting
phenomena
caused
by
more
substantial
causes
ideals
of
which
they
are
mere
instances
For
example
Socrates
thinks
that
perfect
justice
exists
although
it
is
not
clear
where
and
his
own
trial
would
be
cheap
copy
of
it
The
Allegory
of
Cave
is
intimately
connected
to
his
political
ideology
that
only
people
who
have
climbed
out
of
cave
and
cast
their
eyes
on
vision
of
goodness
are
fit
to
rule
Socrates
claims
that
enlightened
men
of
society
must
be
forced
from
their
divine
contemplation
and
be
compelled
to
run
city
according
to
their
lofty
insights
Thus
is
born
idea
of
philosopherking
wise
person
who
accepts
power
thrust
upon
him
by
people
who
are
wise
enough
to
choose
good
master
This
is
main
thesis
of
Socrates
in
Republic
that
most
wisdom
masses
can
muster
is
wise
choice
of
ruler
Ring
of
Gyges
A
ring
which
could
make
one
invisible
Ring
of
Gyges
is
proposed
in
Republic
by
character
of
Glaucon
and
considered
by
rest
of
characters
for
its
ethical
consequences
whether
individual
possessing
it
would
be
most
happy
abstaining
or
doing
injustice
Chariot
He
also
compares
soul
psyche
to
chariot
In
this
allegory
he
introduces
triple
soul
which
composed
of
charioteer
and
two
horses
The
charioteer
is
symbol
of
intellectual
and
logical
part
of
soul
logistikon
and
two
horses
represents
moral
virtues
thymoeides
and
passionate
instincts
epithymetikon
respectively
to
illustrate
conflict
between
them
Dialectic
Socrates
employs
dialectic
method
which
proceeds
by
questioning
The
role
of
dialectic
in
Platos
thought
is
contested
but
there
are
two
main
interpretations
type
of
reasoning
and
method
of
intuition
Simon
Blackburn
adopts
first
saying
that
Platos
dialectic
is
process
of
eliciting
truth
by
means
of
questions
aimed
at
opening
out
what
is
already
implicitly
known
or
at
exposing
contradictions
and
muddles
of
opponents
position
A
similar
interpretation
has
been
put
forth
by
Louis
Hartz
who
suggests
that
elements
of
dialectic
are
borrowed
from
Hegel
According
to
this
view
opposing
arguments
improve
upon
each
other
and
prevailing
opinion
is
shaped
by
synthesis
of
many
conflicting
ideas
over
time
Each
new
idea
exposes
flaw
in
accepted
model
and
epistemological
substance
of
debate
continually
approaches
truth
Hartzs
is
teleological
interpretation
at
core
in
which
philosophers
will
ultimately
exhaust
available
body
of
knowledge
and
thus
reach
end
of
history
Karl
Popper
on
other
hand
claims
that
dialectic
is
art
of
intuition
for
visualising
divine
originals
Forms
or
Ideas
of
unveiling
Great
Mystery
behind
common
mans
everyday
world
of
appearances
Family
Plato
often
discusses
fatherson
relationship
and
question
of
whether
fathers
interest
in
his
sons
has
much
to
do
with
how
well
his
sons
turn
out
In
ancient
Athens
boy
was
socially
located
by
his
family
identity
and
Plato
often
refers
to
his
characters
in
terms
of
their
paternal
and
fraternal
relationships
Socrates
was
not
family
man
and
saw
himself
as
son
of
his
mother
who
was
apparently
midwife
A
divine
fatalist
Socrates
mocks
men
who
spent
exorbitant
fees
on
tutors
and
trainers
for
their
sons
and
repeatedly
ventures
idea
that
good
character
is
gift
from
gods
Platos
dialogue
Crito
reminds
Socrates
that
orphans
are
at
mercy
of
chance
but
Socrates
is
unconcerned
In
Theaetetus
he
is
found
recruiting
as
disciple
young
man
whose
inheritance
has
been
squandered
Socrates
twice
compares
relationship
of
older
man
and
his
boy
lover
to
fatherson
relationship
and
in
Phaedo
Socrates
disciples
towards
whom
he
displays
more
concern
than
his
biological
sons
say
they
will
feel
fatherless
when
he
is
gone
Though
Plato
agreed
with
Aristotle
that
women
were
inferior
to
men
in
fourth
book
of
Republic
character
of
Socrates
says
this
was
only
because
of
nomos
or
custom
and
not
because
of
nature
and
thus
women
needed
paidia
rearing
or
education
to
be
equal
to
men
In
merely
probable
tale
of
eponymous
character
in
Timaeus
unjust
men
who
live
corrupted
lives
would
be
reincarnated
as
women
or
various
animal
kinds
Narration
Plato
never
presents
himself
as
participant
in
any
of
dialogues
and
with
exception
of
Apology
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
heard
any
of
dialogues
firsthand
Some
dialogues
have
no
narrator
but
have
pure
dramatic
form
examples
Meno
Gorgias
Phaedrus
Crito
Euthyphro
some
dialogues
are
narrated
by
Socrates
wherein
he
speaks
in
first
person
examples
Lysis

Republic
One
dialogue
Protagoras
begins
in
dramatic
form
but
quickly
proceeds

Socrates

whom
dialogue
is
named
this
narration

The
Symposium
is
narrated
by
Apollodorus
Socratic
disciple
apparently
to
Glaucon
Apollodorus
assures
his
listener
that
he
is
recounting
story
which
took
place
when
he
himself
was
infant
not
from
his
own
memory
but
as
remembered
by
Aristodemus
who
told
him
story
years
ago
The
Theaetetus
is
peculiar
case
dialogue
in
dramatic
form
embedded
within
another
dialogue
in
dramatic
form
In
beginning
of
Theaetetus
Euclides
says
that
he
compiled
conversation
from
notes
he
took
based
on
what
Socrates
told
him
of
his
conversation
with
title
character
The
rest
of
Theaetetus
is
presented
as
book
written
in
dramatic
form
and
read
by
one
of
Euclides
slaves
Some
scholars
take
this
as
indication
that
Plato
had
by
this
date
wearied
of
narrated
form
With
exception
of
Theaetetus
Plato
gives
no
explicit
indication
as
to
how
these
orally
transmitted
conversations
came
to
be
written
down

some

this

The

thought
worthy
of
criticism
by
some
Cooper
et
al
given
that
it
is
recognized
that
there
is
no
absolute
agreement
as
to
true
chronology
since
facts
of
temporal
order
of
writing
are
not
confidently
ascertained
Chronology
was
not
consideration
in
ancient
times
in
that
groupings
of
this
nature
are
virtually
absent
Tarrant
in
extant
writings
of
ancient
Platonists
Whereas
those
classified
as
early
dialogues
often
conclude
in
aporia
socalled
middle
dialogues
provide
more
clearly
stated
positive
teachings
that
are
often
ascribed
to
Plato
such
as
theory
of
Forms
The
remaining
dialogues
are
classified
as
late
and
are
generally
agreed
to
be
difficult
and
challenging
pieces
of
philosophy
This
grouping
is
only
one
proven
by
stylometric
analysis
Among
those
who
classify
dialogues
into
periods
of
composition
Socrates
figures
in
all
of
early
dialogues
and
they
are
considered
most
faithful
representations
of
historical
Socrates
The
following
represents
one
relatively
common
division
It
should
however
be
kept
in
mind
that
many
of
positions
in
ordering
are
still
highly
disputed
and
also
that
very
notion
that
Platos
dialogues
can
or
should
be
ordered
is
by
no
means
universally
accepted
Increasingly
in
most
recent
Plato
scholarship
writers
are
sceptical
of
notion
that
order
of
Platos
writings
can
be
established
with
any
precision
though
Platos
works
are
still
often
characterized
as
falling
at
least
roughly
into
three
groups
Early
Apology
Charmides
Crito
Euthyphro
Gorgias
Lesser
Hippias
minor
Greater
Hippias
major
Ion
Laches
Lysis
Protagoras
Middle
Cratylus
Euthydemus
Meno
Parmenides
Phaedo
Phaedrus

Late
Critias
Sophist
Statesman
Politicus
Timaeus
Philebus
Laws
A
significant
distinction
of
early
Plato
and
later
Plato
has
been
offered
by
scholars
such
as
ER
Dodds
and
has
been
summarized
by
Harold
Bloom
in
his
book
titled
Agon
ER
Dodds
is
classical
scholar
whose
writings
most
illuminated
Hellenic
descent
in
The
Greeks
and
Irrational
In
his
chapter
on
Plato
and
Irrational
Soul
Dodds
traces
Platos
spiritual
evolution
from
pure
rationalist
of
Protagoras
to
transcendental
psychologist
influenced
by
Pythagoreans
and
Orphics
of
later
works
culminating
in
Laws
Lewis
Campbell
was
first
to
make
exhaustive
use
of
stylometry
to
prove
great
probability
that
Critias
Timaeus
Laws
Philebus
Sophist
and
Statesman
were
all
clustered
together
as
group
while
Parmenides
Phaedrus
Republic
and
Theaetetus
belong
to
separate
group
which
must
be
earlier
given
Aristotles
statement
in
his
Politics
that
Laws
was
written
after
Republic
cf
Diogenes
Lartius
Lives
What
is
remarkable
about
Campbells
conclusions
is
that
in
spite
of
all
stylometric
studies
that
have
been
conducted
since
his
time
perhaps
only
chronological
fact
about
Platos
works
that
can
now
be
said
to
be
proven
by
stylometry
is
fact
that
Critias
Timaeus
Laws
Philebus
Sophist
and
Statesman
are
latest
of
Platos
dialogues
others
earlier
Protagoras
is
often
considered
one
of
last
of
early
dialogues
Three
dialogues
are
often
considered
transitional
or
premiddle
Euthydemus
Gorgias
and
Meno
Proponents
of
dividing
dialogues
into
periods
often
consider
Parmenides
and
Theaetetus
to
come
late
in
middle
period
and
be
transitional
to
next
as
they
seem
to
treat
theory
of
Forms
critically
Parmenides
or
only
indirectly
Theaetetus
Ritters
stylometric
analysis
places
Phaedrus
as
probably
after
Theaetetus
and
Parmenides
although
it
does
not
relate
to
theory
of
Forms
in
same
way
The
first
book
of
Republic
is
often
thought
to
have
been
written
significantly
earlier
than
rest
of
work
although
possibly
having
undergone
revisions
when
later
books
were
attached
to
it
While
looked
to
for
Platos
mature
answers
to
questions
posed
by
his
earlier
works
those
answers
are
difficult
to
discern
Some
scholars
indicate
that
theory
of
Forms
is
absent
from
late
dialogues
its
having
been
refuted
in
Parmenides
but
there
isnt
total
consensus
that
Parmenides
actually
refutes
theory
of
Forms
Writings
of
doubted
authenticity
Jowett
mentions
in
his
Appendix
to
Menexenus
that
works
which
bore
character
of
writer
were
attributed
to
that
writer
even
when
actual
author
was
unknown
For
below
if
there
is
no
consensus
among
scholars
as
to
whether
Plato
is
author
and
if
most
scholars
agree
that
Plato
is
not
author

Some

of
Plato

The

of
Plato
as
received
today
apparently
represent
complete
written
philosophical
work
of
Plato
and
are
generally
good
by
standards
of
textual
criticism
No
modern
edition
of
Plato
in
original
Greek
represents
single

but
rather
it
is
reconstructed
from
multiple
sources
which
are

with
each
other
These

The

Criticism
The
most
famous
criticism
of
Theory
of
Forms
is
Third
Man
Argument
by
Aristotle
in
Metaphysics
Plato
had
actually
already
considered
this
objection
with
idea
of
large
rather
than
man
in
dialogue
Parmenides
using
elderly
Elean
philosophers
Parmenides
and
Zeno
characters
anachronistically
to
criticize
character
of
younger
Socrates
who
proposed
idea
The
dialogue
ends
in
aporia
Many
recent
philosophers
have
diverged
from
what
some
would
describe
as
ontological
models
and
moral
ideals
characteristic
of
traditional
Platonism
A
number
of
these
postmodern
philosophers
have
thus
appeared
to
disparage
Platonism
from
more
or
less
informed
perspectives
Friedrich
Nietzsche
notoriously
attacked
Platos
idea
of
good
itself
along
with
many
fundamentals
of
Christian
morality
which
he
interpreted
as
Platonism
for
masses
in
one
of
his
most
important
works
Beyond
Good
and
Evil
Martin
Heidegger
argued
against
Platos
alleged
obfuscation
of
Being
in
his
incomplete
tome
Being
and
Time
and
philosopher
of
science
Karl
Popper
argued
in
The
Open
Society
and
Its
Enemies
that
Platos
alleged
proposal
for
utopian
political
regime
in
Republic
was
prototypically
totalitarian
The
Dutch
historian
of
science
Eduard
Jan
Dijksterhuis
criticizes
Plato
stating
that
he
was
guilty
of
constructing
imaginary
nature
by
reasoning
from
preconceived
principles
and
forcing
reality
more
or
less
to
adapt
itself
to
this
construction
Dijksterhuis
adds
that
one
of
errors
into
which
Plato
had
fallen
in
almost
grotesque
manner
consisted
in
overestimation
of
what
unaided
thought
ie
without
recourse
to
experience
could
achieve
in
field
of
natural
science

The

anachronistic

In
philosophy
Platos
thought
is
often
compared
with
that
of
his
most
famous
student
Aristotle
whose
reputation
during
Western
Middle
Ages
so
completely
eclipsed
that
of
Plato
that
Scholastic
philosophers
referred
to
Aristotle
as
Philosopher
However
in
Byzantine
Empire
study
of
Plato
continued
The
only
Platonic
work
known
to
western
scholarship
was
Timaeus
until
translations
were
made
after
fall
of
Constantinople
which
occurred
during
George
Gemistos
Plethon
brought
Platos
original
writings
from
Constantinople
in
century
of
its
fall
It
is
believed
that
Plethon
passed
copy
of
Dialogues
to
Cosimo
de
Medici
when
in
Council
of
Ferrara
called
to
unify
Greek
and
Latin
Churches
was
adjourned
to
Florence
where
Plethon
then
lectured
on
relation
and
differences
of
Plato
and
Aristotle
and
fired
Cosimo
with
his
enthusiasm
Cosimo
would
supply
Marsilio
Ficino
with
Platos
text
for
translation
to
Latin
During
early
Islamic
era
Persian
and
Arab
scholars
translated
much
of
Plato
into
Arabic
and
wrote
commentaries
and
interpretations
on
Platos
Aristotles
and
other
Platonist
philosophers
works
see
AlFarabi
Avicenna
Averroes
Hunayn
ibn
Ishaq
Many
of
these
commentaries
on
Plato
were
translated
from
Arabic
into
Latin
and
as
such
influenced
Medieval
scholastic
philosophers
During
Renaissance
with
general
resurgence
of
interest
in
classical
civilization
knowledge
of
Platos
philosophy
would
become
widespread
again
in
West
Many
of
greatest
early
modern
scientists
and
artists
who
broke
with
Scholasticism
and
fostered
flowering
of
Renaissance
with
support
of
Platoinspired
Lorenzo
grandson
of
Cosimo
saw
Platos
philosophy
as
basis
for
progress
in
arts
and
sciences
More
problematic
was
Platos
belief
in
metempsychosis
as
well
as
his
ethical
views
on
polyamory
and
euthanasia
in
particular
which
did
not
match
those
of
Christianity
It
was
Plethons
student
Bessarion
who
reconciled
Plato
with
Christian
theology
arguing
that
Platos
views
were
only
ideals
unattainable
due
to
fall
of
man
The
Cambridge
Platonists
were
around
in
th
century
By
th
century
Platos
reputation
was
restored
and
at
least
on
par
with
Aristotles
Notable
Western
philosophers
have
continued
to
draw
upon
Platos
work
since
that
time
Platos
influence
has
been
especially
strong
in
mathematics
and
sciences
Platos
resurgence
further
inspired
some
of
greatest
advances
in
logic
since
Aristotle
primarily
through
Gottlob
Frege
and
his
followers
Kurt
Gdel
Alonzo
Church
and
Alfred
Tarski
Albert
Einstein
suggested
that
scientist
who
takes
philosophy
seriously
would
have
to
avoid
systematization
and
take
on
many
different
roles
and
possibly
appear
as
Platonist
or
Pythagorean
in
that
such
one
would
have
viewpoint
of
logical
simplicity
as
indispensable
and
effective
tool
of
his
research
The
safest
general
characterization
of
European
philosophical
tradition
is
that
it
consists
of
series
of
footnotes
to
Plato
Alfred
North
Whitehead
Process
and
Reality
The
political
philosopher
and
professor
Leo
Strauss
is
considered
by
some
as
prime
thinker
involved
in
recovery
of
Platonic
thought
in
its
more
political
and
less
metaphysical
form
Strauss
political
approach
was
in
part
inspired
by
appropriation
of
Plato
and
Aristotle
by
medieval
Jewish
and
Islamic
political
philosophers
especially
Maimonides
and
AlFarabi
as
opposed
to
Christian
metaphysical
tradition
that
developed
from
Neoplatonism
Deeply
influenced
by
Nietzsche
and
Heidegger
Strauss
nonetheless
rejects
their
condemnation
of
Plato
and
looks
to
dialogues
for
solution
to

as

More
broadly
platonism
sometimes
distinguished
from
Platos
particular
view
by
lowercase
refers
to
view
that
there
are
many
abstract
objects
Still
to
this
day
platonists
take
number
and
truths
of
mathematics
as
best
support
in
favour
of
this
view
Most
mathematicians
think
like
platonists
that
numbers
and
truths
of
mathematics
are
perceived
by
reason
rather
than
senses
yet
exist
independently
of
minds
and
people
that
is
to
say
they
are
discovered
rather
than
inventedcitation

Contemporary
platonism
is
also
more
open
to
idea
of
there
being
infinitely
many
abstract
objects
as
numbers
or
propositions
might
qualify
as
abstract
objects
while
ancient
Platonism
seemed
to
resist
this
view
possibly
because
of
need
to
overcome
problem
of
One
and
Many
Thus
e
g
in
Parmenides
dialogue
Plato
denies
there
are
Forms
for
more
mundane
things
like
hair
and
mud
However
he
repeatedly
does
support
idea
that
there
are
Forms
of
artifacts
e
g
Form
of
Bed
Contemporary
platonism
also
tends
to
view
abstract
objects
as
unable
to
cause
anything
but
it
is
unclear
whether
ancient
Platonists
felt
this
waycitation

Notes
subject
of
philosophy
as
it
is
often
conceived
rigorous
and
systematic
examination
of
ethical
political
metaphysical
and
epistemological
issues
armed
with
distinctive
methodcan
be
called
his
invention
Though
influenced
primarily
by
Socrates
to
extent
that
Socrates
is
usually
main
character
in
many
of
Platos
writings
he
was
also
influenced
by
Heraclitus
Parmenides
and
Pythagoreans
Diogenes
Lartius
mentions
that
Plato
was
born
according
to
some
writers
in
Aegina
in
house
of
Phidiades
son
of
Thales
Diogenes
mentions
as
one
of
his
sources
Universal
History
of
Favorinus
According
to
Favorinus
Ariston
Platos
family
and
his
family
were
sent
by
Athens
to
settle
as
cleruchs
colonists
retaining
their
Athenian
citizenship
on
island
of
Aegina
from
which
Spartans
expelled
them
after
Platos
birth
there
Nails
points
out
however
that
there
is
no
record
of
any
Spartan
expulsion
of
Athenians
from
Aegina
between
BC
On
other
hand
at
Peace
of
Nicias
Aegina
was
silently
left
under
Athens
control
and
it
was
not
until
summer
of
that
Spartans
overran
island
Therefore
Nails
concludes
that
perhaps
Ariston
was
cleruch
perhaps
he
went
to
Aegina
in
and
perhaps
Plato
was
born
on
Aegina
but
none
of
this
enables
precise
dating
of
Aristons
death
or
Platos
birth
Aegina
is
regarded
as
Platos
place
of
birth
by
Suda
as
well
Apollodorus
of
Athens
said
Plato
was
born
on
seventh
day
of
month
Thargelion
according
to
this
tradition
god
Apollo
was
born
this
day
Renaissance
Platonists
celebrated
Platos
birth
on
November
Ulrich
von
WilamowitzMoellendorff
estimates
that
Plato
was
born
when
Diotimos
was
archon
eponymous
namely
between
July
BC
and
July
BC
Greek
philologist
Ioannis
Kalitsounakis
believes
that
he
was
born
on
May
or
BC
According
to
James
Adam
some
have
held
that
Glaucon
and
Adeimantus
were
uncles
of
Plato
but
Zeller
decides
for
usual
view
that
they
were
brothers
From
aristos
and
kleos
A
scroll
by
Philodemus
analysed
in
may
suggest
that
Plato
was
enslaved
earlier
than
was
previously
believed
He
regarded
logistic
as
appropriate
for
business
men
and
men
of
war
who
must
learn
art
of
numbers
or
he
will
not
know
how
to
array
his
troops
while
arithmetic
was
appropriate
for
philosophers
because
he
has
to
arise
out
of
sea
of
change
and
lay
hold
of
true
being
Plotinus
describes
this
in
last
part
of
his
final
Ennead
VI
entitled
On
Good
or
One
Jens
Halfwassen
states
in
Der
Aufstieg
zum
Einen
that
Plotinus
ontologywhich
should
be
called
Plotinus
henologyis
rather
accurate
philosophical
renewal
and
continuation
of
Platos
unwritten
doctrine
ie
doctrine
rediscovered
by
Krmer
and
Gaiser
In
one
of
his
letters
Epistolae
Ficino
writes
The
main
goal
of
divine
Plato
is
to
show
one
principle
of
things
which
he
called
One
cf
Montoriola
p
For
brief
description
of
problem
see
for
example
Gaiser
A
more
detailed
analysis
is
given
by
Krmer
Another
description
is
by
Reale
and
Reale
A
thorough
analysis
of
consequences
of
such
approach
is
given
by
Szlezak
Another
supporter
of
this
interpretation
is
German
philosopher
Karl
Albert
cf
Albert
or
Albert
HansGeorg
Gadamer
is
also
sympathetic
towards
it
cf
Grondin
and
Gadamer
Gadamers
final
position
on
subject
is
stated
in
Gadamer
Some
use
term
allegory
instead
of
myth
This
is
in
accordance
with
practice
in
specialized
literature
in
which
it
is
common
to
find
that
terms
allegory
and
myth
are
used
as
synonyms
Nevertheless
there
is
trend
among
modern
scholars
to
use
term
myth
and
avoid
term
allegory
as
it
is
considered
more
appropriate
to
modern
interpretation
of
Platos
writings
One
of
first
to
initiate
this
trend
was
Oxford
University
professor
John
Alexander
Stewart
in
his
work
The
Myths
of
Plato
The
time
is
not
long
after
death
of
Socrates
for
Pythagoreans
Echecrates
co
have
not
heard
any
details
yet

of
various
philosophies
existing
prior
to
him
It
was
above
all
from
his
teachings
that
West
inherited
its
intellectual
lexicon
as
well
as
problems
and
methods
of
inquiry
As
result
his
philosophy
has
exerted
unique
influence
on
almost
every
form
of
knowledge
in
West
and
it
continues
to
be
subject
of
contemporary
philosophical
discussion
Little
is
known
about
his
life
Aristotle
was
born
in
city
of
Stagira
in
Northern
Greece
His
father
Nicomachus
died
when
Aristotle
was
child
and
he
was
brought
up
by
guardian
At
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
he
joined
Platos
Academy
in
Athens
and
remained
there
until
age
of
thirtyseven
c
BC
Shortly
after
Plato
died
Aristotle
left
Athens
and
at
request
of
Philip
II
of
Macedon
tutored
Alexander
Great
beginning
in
BC
He
established
library
in
Lyceum
which
helped
him
to
produce
many
of
his
hundreds
of
books
on
papyrus
scrolls
Though
Aristotle
wrote
many
elegant
treatises
and
dialogues
for
publication
only
around
third
of
his
original
output
has
survived
none
of
it
intended
for
publication
Aristotles
views
on
physical
science
profoundly
shaped
medieval
scholarship
Their
influence
extended
from
Late
Antiquity
and
Early
Middle
Ages
into
Renaissance
and
were
not
replaced
systematically
until
Enlightenment
and
theories
such
as
classical
mechanics
were
developed
Some
of
Aristotles
zoological
observations
found
in
his
biology
such
as
on
hectocotyl
reproductive
arm
of
octopus
were
disbelieved
until
th
century
His
works
contain
earliest
known
formal
study
of
logic
studied
by
medieval
scholars
such
as
Peter
Abelard
and
John
Buridan
Aristotles
influence
on
logic
also
continued
well
into
th
century
He
influenced
JudeoIslamic
philosophies
during
Middle
Ages
as
well
as
Christian
theology
especially
Neoplatonism
of
Early
Church
and
scholastic
tradition
of
Catholic
Church
Aristotle
was
revered
among
medieval
Muslim
scholars
as
The
First
Teacher
and
among
medieval
Christians
like
Thomas
Aquinas
as
simply
The
Philosopher
His
ethics

Life
School
of
Aristotle
in
Mieza
Macedonia
Greece
In
general
details
of
Aristotles
life
are
not
wellestablished
The
biographies
written
in
ancient
times
are
often
speculative
and
historians
only
agree
on
few
salient
pointsB
Aristotle
whose
name
means
best
purpose
in
Ancient
Greek
was
born
in
BC
in
Stagira
Chalcidice
about
km
miles
east
of
modernday
Thessaloniki
His
father
Nicomachus
was
personal
physician
to
King
Amyntas
of
Macedon
While
he
was
young
Aristotle
learned
about
biology
and
medical
information
which
was
taught
by
his
father
Both
of
Aristotles
parents
died
when
he
was
about
thirteen
and
Proxenus
of
Atarneus
became
his
guardian
Although
little
information
about
Aristotles
childhood
has
survived
he
probably
spent
some
time
within
Macedonian
palace
making
his
first
connections
with
Macedonian
monarchy
At
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
Aristotle
moved
to
Athens
to
continue
his
education
at
Platos
Academy
He
probably
experienced
Eleusinian
Mysteries
as
he
wrote
when
describing
sights
one
viewed
at
Eleusinian
Mysteries
to
experience
is
to
learn
Aristotle
remained
in
Athens
for
nearly
twenty
years
before
leaving
in
BC
The
traditional
story
about
his
departure
records
that
he
was
disappointed
with
Academys
direction
after
control
passed
to
Platos
nephew
Speusippus
although
it
is
possible
that
he
feared
antiMacedonian
sentiments
in
Athens
at
that
time
and
left
before
Plato
died
Aristotle
then
accompanied
Xenocrates
to
court
of
his
friend
Hermias
of
Atarneus
in
Asia
Minor
After
death
of
Hermias
Aristotle
travelled
with
his
pupil
Theophrastus
to
island
of
Lesbos
where
together
they
researched
botany
and
zoology
of
island
and
its
sheltered
lagoon
While
in
Lesbos
Aristotle
married
Pythias
either
Hermiass
adoptive
daughter
or
niece
She
bore
him
daughter
whom
they
also
named
Pythias
In
BC
Aristotle
was
invited
by
Philip
II
of
Macedon
to
become
tutor
to
his
son
Alexander

Aristotle
was
appointed
as
head
of
royal
academy
of
Macedon
During
Aristotles
time
in
Macedonian
court
he
gave
lessons
not
only
to
Alexander
but
also
to
two
other
future
kings
Ptolemy
and
Cassander
Aristotle
encouraged
Alexander
toward
eastern
conquest
and
Aristotles
own
attitude
towards
Persia
was
unabashedly
ethnocentric
In
one
famous
example
he
counsels
Alexander
to
be
leader
to
Greeks
and
despot
to
barbarians
to
look
after
former
as
after
friends
and
relatives
and
to
deal
with
latter
as
with
beasts
or
plants
By
BC
Aristotle
had
returned
to
Athens
establishing
his
own
school
there
known
as
Lyceum
Aristotle
conducted
courses
at
school
for
next
twelve
years
While
in
Athens
his
wife
Pythias
died
and
Aristotle
became
involved
with
Herpyllis
of
Stagira
who
bore
him
son
whom
he
named
after
his
father
Nicomachus
If
Suda
uncritical
compilation
from
Middle
Ages
is
accurate
he
may
also
have
had
ermenos
Palaephatus
of
Abydus
This
period
in
Athens
between
and
BC
is
when
Aristotle
is
believed
to
have
composed
many
of
his
works
He
wrote
many
dialogues
of
which
only
fragments
have
survived
Those
works
that
have
survived
are
in
treatise
form
and
were
not
for
most
part
intended
for
widespread
publication
they
are
generally
thought
to
be
lecture
aids
for
his
students
His
most
important
treatises
include
Physics
Metaphysics
Nicomachean

Near
end
of
his
life
Alexander
and
Aristotle
became
estranged
over
Alexanders
relationship
with
Persia
and
Persians
A
widespread
tradition
in
antiquity

Aristotle
of
playing
role
in
Alexanders
death
but
only
evidence
of
this

claim
made
some
six
years
after
death
Following
Alexanders
death
antiMacedonian
sentiment
in
Athens
was
rekindled
In
BC
Demophilus
and
Eurymedon
Hierophant
reportedly
denounced
Aristotle
for
impiety
prompting
him
to
flee
to
his

in

Metaphysics
Aristotle
The
word
metaphysics
appears
to
have
been
coined
by
first
century
AD
editor
who
assembled
various
small
selections
of
Aristotles
works
to
treatise
we
know
by
name
Metaphysics
Aristotle
called
it
first
philosophy
and
distinguished
it
from
mathematics
and
natural
science
physics
as
contemplative
theoretik
philosophy
which
is
theological
and
studies
divine
He
wrote
in
his
Metaphysics
a
if
there
were
no
other
independent
things
besides
composite
natural
ones
study
of
nature
would
be
primary
kind
of
knowledge
but
if
there
is
some
motionless
independent
thing
knowledge
of
this
precedes
it
and
is
first
philosophy
and
it
is
universal
in
just
this
way
because
it
is
first
And
it
belongs
to
this
sort
of
philosophy
to
study
being
as
being
both
what
it
is
and
what
belongs
to
it
just
by
virtue
of

Substance
Further
information
Hylomorphism
Aristotle
examines
concepts
of
substance
ousia
and
essence
to
ti
n
einai
what
it
was
to
be
in
his
Metaphysics
Book
VII
and
he
concludes
that
particular
substance
is
combination
of
both
matter
and
form
philosophical
theory
called
hylomorphism
In
Book
VIII
he
distinguishes
matter
of
substance
as
substratum
or
stuff
of
which
it
is
composed
For
example
matter
of
house
is
bricks
stones
timbers
etc
or
whatever
constitutes
potential
house
while
form
of
substance
is
actual
house
namely
covering
for
bodies
and
chattels
or
any
other
differentia
that
let
us
define
something
as
house
The
formula
that
gives
components
is
account
of
matter
and
formula
that
gives

is

Immanent

Main

Aristotles
theory
of
universals
Platos
forms
exist
as
universals
like
ideal
form
of
apple
For
Aristotle
both
matter
and
form
belong
to
individual
thing
hylomorphism
Like
his
teacher
Plato
Aristotles
philosophy
aims
at
universal
Aristotles
ontology
places
universal
katholou
in
particulars
kath
hekaston
things
in
world
whereas
for
Plato
universal
is
separately
existing
form
which
actual
things
imitate
For
Aristotle
form
is
still
what
phenomena
are
based
on
but
is
instantiated
in
particular
substance
Plato
argued
that
all
things
have
universal
form
which
could
be
either
property
or
relation
to
other
things
When
one
looks
at
apple
for
example
one
sees
apple
and
one
can
also
analyse
form
of
apple
In
this
distinction
there
is
particular
apple
and
universal
form
of
apple
Moreover
one
can
place
apple
next
to
book
so
that
one
can
speak
of
both
book
and
apple
as
being
next
to
each
other
Plato
argued
that
there
are
some
universal
forms
that
are
not
part
of
particular
things
For
example
it
is
possible
that
there
is
no
particular
good
in
existence
but
good
is
still
proper
universal
form
Aristotle
disagreed
with
Plato
on
this
point
arguing
that
all
universals
are
instantiated
at
some
period
of
time
and
that
there
are
no
universals
that
are
unattached
to
existing
things
In
addition
Aristotle
disagreed
with
Plato
about
location
of
universals
Where
Plato
spoke
of
world
of
forms
place
where
all
universal
forms
subsist
Aristotle
maintained
that
universals
exist
within
each
thing
on
which
each
universal
is
predicated
So
according
to
Aristotle
form
of
apple
exists
within
each
apple
rather
than
in
world
of
forms
Potentiality
and
actuality
Further
information
Potentiality
and
actuality
Aristotle
With
regard
to
change
kinesis
and
its
causes
now
as
he
defines
in
his
Physics
and
On
Generation
and
Corruption
ba
he
distinguishes
coming
to
be
from
growth
and
diminution
which
is
change
in
quantity
locomotion
which
is
change
in
space
and
alteration
which
is
change
in
quality
Aristotle
argued
that
capability
like
playing
flute
could
be
acquired
potential
made
actual
by
learning
The
coming
to
be
is
change
where
nothing
persists
of
which
resultant
is
property
In
that
particular
change
he
introduces
concept
of
potentiality
dynamis
and
actuality
entelecheia
in
association
with
matter
and
form
Referring
to
potentiality
this
is
what
thing
is
capable
of
doing
or
being
acted
upon
if
conditions
are
right
and
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
else
For
example
seed
of
plant
in
soil
is
potentially
dynamei
plant
and
if
it
is
not
prevented
by
something
it
will
become
plant
Potentially
beings
can
either
act
poiein
or
be
acted
upon
paschein
which
can
be
either
innate
or
learned
For
example
eyes
possess
potentiality
of
sight
innate
being
acted
upon
while
capability
of
playing
flute
can
be
possessed
by
learning
exercise
acting
Actuality
is
fulfilment
of
end
of
potentiality
Because
end
telos
is
principle
of
every
change
and
for
sake
of
end
exists
potentiality
therefore
actuality
is
end
Referring
then
to
previous
example
it
can
be
said
that
actuality
is
when
plant
does
one
of
activities
that
plants
do
For
that
for
sake
of
which
to
hou
heneka
thing
is
is
its
principle
and
becoming
is
for
sake
of
end
and
actuality
is
end
and
it
is
for
sake
of
this
that
potentiality
is
acquired
For
animals
do
not
see
in
order
that
they
may
have
sight
but
they
have
sight
that
they
may
see
In
summary
matter
used
to
make
house
has
potentiality
to
be
house
and
both
activity
of
building
and
form
of
final
house
are
actualities
which
is
also
final
cause
or
end
Then
Aristotle
proceeds
and
concludes
that
actuality
is
prior
to
potentiality
in
formula
in
time
and
in
substantiality
With
this
definition
of
particular
substance
ie
matter
and
form
Aristotle
tries
to
solve
problem
of
unity
of
beings
for
example
what
is
it
that
makes
man
one
Since
according
to
Plato
there
are
two
Ideas
animal
and
biped
how
then
is
man
unity
However
according
to
Aristotle
potential
being
matter
and
actual
one
form
are
one
and
same
Epistemology
Aristotles
immanent
realism
means
his
epistemology
is
based
on
study
of
things
that
exist
or
happen
in
world
and
rises
to
knowledge
of
universal
whereas
for
Plato
epistemology
begins
with
knowledge
of
universal
Forms
or
ideas
and
descends
to
knowledge
of
particular
imitations
of
these
Aristotle
uses
induction
from
examples
alongside
deduction
whereas
Plato
relies
on
deduction
from
priori
principles
Natural
philosophy
Aristotles
natural
philosophy
spans
wide
range
of
natural
phenomena
including
those
now
covered
by
physics
biology
and
other
natural
sciences
In
Aristotles
terminology
natural
philosophy
is
branch
of
philosophy
examining
phenomena
of
natural
world
and
includes
fields
that
would
be
regarded
today
as
physics
biology
and
other
natural
sciences
Aristotles
work
encompassed
virtually
all
facets
of
intellectual
inquiry
Aristotle
makes
philosophy
in
broad
sense
coextensive
with
reasoning
which
he
also
would
describe
as
science
However
his
use
of
term
science
carries
different
meaning
than
that
covered
by
term
scientific
method
For
Aristotle
all
science
dianoia
is
either
practical
poetical
or
theoretical
Metaphysics
b
His
practical
science
includes
ethics
and
politics
his
poetical
science
means

of
fine
arts

his
theoretical

With

it
can

that
as

objects
on

require
more

Aristotles
laws
of

In
Physics
he
states
that
objects
fall
at
speed
proportional
to
their
weight
and
inversely
proportional
to
density
of
fluid
they
are
immersed
in
This
is
correct
approximation
for
objects
in
Earths
gravitational
field
moving
in
air
or

In
Physics
a
Aristotle
effectively
states
quantitative
law

implies

that

is
not
possible
Opinions
have
varied
on
whether
Aristotle
intended
to
state
quantitative
laws
Henri
Carteron
held
extreme
view
that
Aristotles
concept
of
force
was
basically
qualitative
but
other
authors
reject
this

Aristotles
theory
that

Aristotles
writings
on
motion
remained
influential
until
Early
Modern
period
John
Philoponus
in
Middle
Ages
and
Galileo
are
said
to
have
shown
by
experiment
that
Aristotles
claim
that
heavier
object
falls
faster
than
lighter
object
is
incorrect
A
contrary
opinion
is
given
by
Carlo
Rovelli
who
argues
that
Aristotles
physics
of
motion
is
correct
within
its
domain
of
validity
that
of
objects
in
Earths
gravitational
field
immersed
in
fluid
such
as
air
In
this
system
heavy
bodies
in
steady
fall
indeed

is

not

Aristotles

Aristotles
assumption
that

immediately
it
stops
acting
eg
ball

throwers
hand
has
awkward

he
has
to
suppose
that

helps
to
push
ball
along

Four
causes
Main
article
Four
causes
Aristotle
argued
by
analogy
with
woodwork
that
thing
takes
its
form
from
four
causes
in
case
of
table
wood
used
material
cause
its
design
formal
cause
tools
and
techniques
used
efficient
cause
and
its
decorative
or
practical
purpose
final
cause
Aristotle
suggested
that
reason
for
anything
coming
about
can
be
attributed
to
four
different
types
of
simultaneously
active
factors
His
term
aitia
is
traditionally
translated
as
cause
but
it
does
not
always
refer
to
temporal
sequence
it
might
be
better
translated
as
explanation
but
traditional
rendering
will
be
employed
here
Material
cause
describes
material
out
of
which
something
is
composed
Thus
material
cause
of
table
is
wood
It
is
not
about
action
It
does
not
mean
that
one
domino
knocks
over
another
domino
The
formal
cause
is
its
form
ie
arrangement
of
that
matter
It
tells
one
what
thing
is
that
thing
is
determined
by
definition
form
pattern
essence
whole
synthesis
or
archetype
It
embraces
account
of
causes
in
terms
of
fundamental
principles
or
general
laws
as
whole
ie
macrostructure
is
cause
of
its
parts
relationship
known
as
wholepart
causation
Plainly
put
formal
cause
is
idea
in
mind
of
sculptor
that
brings
sculpture
into
being
A
simple
example
of
formal
cause
is
mental
image
or
idea
that
allows
artist
architect
or
engineer
to
create
drawing
The
efficient
cause
is
primary
source
or
that
from
which
change
under
consideration
proceeds
It
identifies
what
makes
of
what
is
made
and
what
causes
change
of
what
is
changed
and
so
suggests
all
sorts
of
agents
nonliving
or
living
acting
as
sources
of
change
or
movement
or
rest
Representing
current
understanding
of
causality
as
relation
of
cause
and
effect
this
covers
modern
definitions
of
cause
as
either
agent
or
agency
or
particular
events
or
states
of
affairs
In
case
of
two
dominoes
when
first
is
knocked
over
it
causes
second
also
to
fall
over
In
case
of
animals
this
agency
is
combination
of
how
it
develops
from
egg
and
how
its
body
functions
The
final
cause
telos
is
its
purpose
reason
why
thing
exists
or
is
done
including
both
purposeful
and
instrumental
actions
and
activities
The
final
cause
is
purpose
or
function
that
something
is
supposed
to
serve
This
covers
modern
ideas
of
motivating
causes
such
as
volition
In
case
of
living
things
it
implies
adaptation
to
particular
way
of
life

According
to
Aristotle
spontaneity
and
chance
are
causes
of
some
things
distinguishable
from
other
types
of
cause
such
as
simple
necessity
Chance
as
incidental
cause
lies
in

of
accidental
things
from
what
is
spontaneous
There
is
also
more

of

History
of
geology
Aristotle
noted
that
ground
level
of
Aeolian
islands
changed
before
volcanic
eruption
Aristotle
was
one
of
first
people
to
record
any
geological
observations
He
stated
that
geological
change
was
too
slow
to
be
observed
in
one
persons
lifetime
The
geologist
Charles
Lyell
noted
that
Aristotle
described
such
change
including
lakes
that
had
dried
up
and
deserts
that
had
become
watered
by
rivers
giving
as
examples
growth
of
Nile
delta
since
time
of
Homer
and
upheaving
of
one
of
Aeolian
islands
previous
to
volcanic
eruption
Aristotle
also
made
many
observations
about
hydrologic
cycle
and
meteorology
including
his
major
writings
Meteorologica
For
example
he
made
some
of
earliest
observations
about
desalination
he
observed
early
and
correctly
that
when
seawater
is
heated
freshwater
evaporates
and
that
oceans
are
then
replenished
by
cycle
of
rainfall
and
river
runoff

Empirical
research
Aristotle
was
first
person
to
study
biology
systematically
and
biology
forms
large
part
of
his
writings
He
spent
two
years
observing
and
describing
zoology
of
Lesbos
and
surrounding
seas
including
in
particular
Pyrrha
lagoon
in
centre
of
Lesbos
His
data
in
History
of
Animals
Generation
of
Animals
Movement
of
Animals
and
Parts
of
Animals
are
assembled
from
his
own
observations
statements
given
by
people
with
specialized
knowledge
such
as
beekeepers
and
fishermen
and
less
accurate
accounts
provided
by
travellers
from
overseas
His
apparent
emphasis
on
animals
rather
than
plants
is
historical
accident
his
works
on
botany
have
been
lost
but
two
books
on
plants
by
his
pupil
Theophrastus
have
survived
Aristotle
reports
on
sealife
visible
from
observation
on
Lesbos
and
catches
of
fishermen
He
describes
catfish
electric
ray
and
frogfish
in
detail
as
well
as
cephalopods
such
as
octopus
and
paper
nautilus
His
description
of
hectocotyl
arm
of
cephalopods
used
in
sexual
reproduction
was
widely
disbelieved
until
th
century
He
gives
accurate
descriptions
of
fourchambered
forestomachs
of
ruminants
and
of
ovoviviparous
embryological
development
of
hound
shark
He
notes
that
animals
structure
is
well
matched
to
function
so
among
birds
heron
which
lives
in
marshes
with
soft
mud
and
lives
by
catching
fish
has
long
neck
and
long
legs
and
sharp
spearlike
beak
whereas
ducks
that
swim
have
short
legs
and
webbed
feet
Darwin
too
noted
these
sorts
of
differences
between
similar
kinds
of
animal
but
unlike
Aristotle
used
data
to
come
to
theory
of
evolution
Aristotles
writings
can
seem
to
modern
readers
close
to
implying
evolution
but
while
Aristotle
was
aware
that
new
mutations
or
hybridizations
could
occur
he
saw
these
as
rare
accidents
For
Aristotle
accidents
like
heat
waves
in
winter
must
be
considered
distinct
from
natural
causes
He
was
thus
critical
of
Empedocless
materialist
theory
of
survival
of
fittest
origin
of
living
things
and
their
organs
and
ridiculed
idea
that
accidents
could
lead
to
orderly
results
To
put
his
views
into
modern
terms
he
nowhere
says
that
different
species
can
have
common
ancestor
or
that
one
kind
can
change
into
another
or
that
kinds
can
become
extinct
Scientific
style
Aristotle
inferred
growth
laws
from
his
observations
on
animals
including
that
brood
size
decreases
with
body
mass
whereas
gestation
period
increases
He
was
correct
in
these
predictions
at
least
for
mammals
data
are
shown
for
mouse
and
elephant
Aristotle
did
not
do
experiments
in
modern
sense
He
used
ancient
Greek
term
pepeiramenoi
to
mean
observations
or
at
most
investigative
procedures
like
dissection
In
Generation
of
Animals
he
finds
fertilized
hens
egg
of
suitable
stage
and
opens
it
to
see
embryos
heart
beating
inside
Instead
he
practiced
different
style
of
science
systematically
gathering
data
discovering
patterns
common
to
whole
groups
of
animals
and
inferring
possible
causal
explanations
from
these
This
style
is
common
in
modern
biology
when
large
amounts
of
data
become
available
in
new
field
such
as
genomics
It
does
not
result
in
same
certainty
as
experimental
science
but
it
sets
out
testable
hypotheses
and
constructs
narrative
explanation
of
what
is
observed
In
this
sense
Aristotles
biology
is
scientific
From
data
he
collected
and
documented
Aristotle
inferred
quite
number
of
rules
relating
lifehistory
features
of
livebearing
tetrapods
terrestrial
placental
mammals
that
he
studied
Among
these
correct
predictions
are
following
Brood
size
decreases
with
adult
body
mass
so
that
elephant
has
fewer
young
usually
just
one
per
brood
than
mouse
Lifespan
increases
with
gestation
period
and
also
with
body
mass
so
that
elephants
live
longer
than
mice
have
longer
period
of
gestation
and
are
heavier
As
final
example
fecundity
decreases
with
lifespan
so
longlived
kinds
like
elephants
have
fewer
young
in
total
than
shortlived
kinds
like
mice

Those

were

recognised
that

such
as
that

Psychology
Soul
Further
information
On
Soul
Aristotle
proposed
threepart
structure
for
souls
of
plants
animals
and
humans
making
humans
unique
in
having
all
three
types
of
soul
Aristotles
psychology
given
in
his
treatise
On
Soul
peri
psychs
posits
three
kinds
of
soul
psyches
vegetative
soul
sensitive
soul
and
rational
soul
Humans
have
rational
soul
The
human
soul
incorporates
powers
of
other
kinds
Like
vegetative
soul
it
can
grow
and
nourish
itself
like
sensitive
soul
it
can
experience
sensations
and
move
locally
The
unique
part
of
human
rational
soul
is
its
ability
to
receive
forms
of
other
things
and
to
compare
them
using
nous
intellect
and
logos
reason
For
Aristotle
soul
is
form
of
living
being
Because
all
beings
are
composites
of
form
and
matter
form
of
living
beings
is
that
which
endows
them
with
what
is
specific
to
living
beings
eg
ability
to
initiate
movement
or
in
case
of
plants
growth
and
chemical
transformations
which
Aristotle
considers
types
of
movement
In
contrast
to
earlier
philosophers
but
in
accordance
with
Egyptians
he
placed
rational
soul
in
heart
rather
than
brain
Notable
is
Aristotles
division
of
sensation
and
thought
which
generally
differed
from
concepts
of
previous
philosophers
with
exception
of
Alcmaeon
Memory
According
to
Aristotle
in
On
Soul
memory
is
ability
to
hold
perceived
experience
in
mind
and
to
distinguish
between
internal
appearance
and
occurrence
in
past
In
other
words
memory
is
mental
picture
phantasm
that
can
be
recovered
Aristotle
believed
impression
is
left
on
semifluid
bodily
organ
that
undergoes
several
changes
in
order
to
make
memory
A
memory
occurs
when
stimuli
such
as
sights
or
sounds
are
so
complex
that
nervous
system
cannot
receive
all
impressions
at
once
These
changes
are
same
as
those
involved
in
operations
of
sensation
Aristotelian
common
sense
and
thinking
Aristotle
uses
term
memory
for
actual
retaining
of
experience
in
impression
that
can
develop
from
sensation
and
for
intellectual
anxiety
that
comes
with
impression
because
it
is
formed
at
particular
time
and
processing
specific
contents
Memory
is
of
past
prediction
is
of
future
and
sensation
is
of

Retrieval
of
impressions
cannot
be
performed
suddenly
A
transitional
channel
is
needed
and
located
in
past
experiences
both
for
previous
experience
and
present
experience
Because
Aristotle
believes
people
receive
all
kinds
of
sense
perceptions
and
perceive
them
as
impressions
people
are
continually
weaving
together
new
impressions
of
experiences
To
search
for
these
impressions
people
search
memory
itself
Within
memory
if
one
experience
is
offered
instead
of
specific
memory
that
person
will
reject
this
experience
until
they
find
what
they
are
looking
for
Recollection
occurs
when
one
retrieved
experience
naturally
follows
another
If

When
people
recall
experiences
they
stimulate
certain
previous
experiences
until
they
reach
one
that
is
needed
Recollection
is
thus
selfdirected
activity
of
retrieving
information
stored
in

impression
Only
humans
can
remember
impressions
of
intellectual
activity
such
as
numbers
and
words
Animals
that
have
perception
of
time
can
retrieve
memories
of
their
past
observations
Remembering
involves
only
perception
of
things
remembered
and
of
time
passed
Senses

in
Aristotles
psychology
Impressions
are
stored
in

heart
linked
by
his
laws
of
association
similarity
contrast
and
contiguity
Aristotle
believed
chain
of
thought
which
ends
in
recollection
of
certain
impressions
was
connected
systematically
in
relationships
such
as
similarity
contrast
and
contiguity
described
in
his
laws
of
association
Aristotle
believed
that
past
experiences
are
hidden
within
mind
A
force
operates
to
awaken
hidden
material
to
bring
up
actual
experience
According
to
Aristotle
association
is
power
innate
in
mental
state
which
operates
upon
unexpressed
remains
of
former
experiences
allowing
them
to
rise
and
be
recalled
Dreams
Further
information
Dream
Classical
history
Aristotle
describes
sleep
in
On
Sleep
and
Wakefulness
Sleep
takes
place
as
result
of
overuse
of
senses
or
of
digestion
so
it
is
vital
to
body
While
person
is
asleep
critical
activities
which
include
thinking
sensing
recalling
and
remembering
do
not
function
as
they
do
during
wakefulness
Since
person
cannot
sense
during
sleep
they
cannot
have
desire
which
is
result
of
sensation
However
senses
are
able
to
work
during
sleep
albeit
differently
unless
they
are
weary
Dreams
do
not
involve
actually
sensing
stimulus
In
dreams
sensation
is
still
involved
but
in
altered
manner
Aristotle
explains
that
when
person
stares
at
moving
stimulus
such
as
waves
in
body
of
water
and
then
looks
away
next
thing
they
look
at
appears
to
have
wavelike
motion
When
person
perceives
stimulus
and
stimulus
is
no
longer
focus
of
their
attention
it
leaves
impression
When
body
is
awake
and
senses
are
functioning
properly
person
constantly
encounters
new
stimuli
to
sense
and
so
impressions
of
previously
perceived
stimuli
are
ignored
However
during
sleep
impressions
made
throughout
day
are
noticed
as
there
are
no
new
distracting
sensory
experiences
So
dreams
result
from
these
lasting
impressions
Since
impressions
are
all
that
are
left
and
not
exact
stimuli
dreams
do
not
resemble
actual
waking
experience
During
sleep
person
is
in
altered
state
of
mind
Aristotle
compares
sleeping
person
to
person
who
is
overtaken
by
strong
feelings
toward
stimulus
For
example
person
who
has
strong
infatuation
with
someone
may
begin
to
think
they
see
that
person
everywhere
because
they
are
so
overtaken
by
their
feelings
Since
person
sleeping
is
in
suggestible
state
and
unable
to
make
judgements
they
become
easily
deceived
by
what
appears
in
their
dreams
like
infatuated
person
This
leads
person
to
believe
dream
is
real
even
when
dreams
are
absurd
in
nature
In
De
Anima
iii
Aristotle
ascribes
ability
to
create
to
store
and
to
recall
images
in
absence
of
perception
to
faculty
of
imagination
phantasia
One
component
of
Aristotles
theory
of
dreams
disagrees
with
previously
held
beliefs
He
claimed
that
dreams
are
not
foretelling
and
not
sent
by
divine
being
Aristotle
reasoned
naturalistically
that
instances
in
which
dreams
do
resemble
future
events
are
simply
coincidences
Aristotle
claimed
that
dream
is
first
established
by
fact
that
person
is
asleep
when
they
experience
it
If
person
had
image
appear
for
moment
after
waking
up
or
if
they
see
something
in
dark
it
is
not
considered
dream
because
they
were
awake
when
it
occurred
Secondly
any
sensory
experience
that
is
perceived
while
person
is
asleep
does
not
qualify
as
part
of
dream
For
example
if
while
person
is
sleeping
door
shuts
and
in
their
dream
they
hear
door
is
shut
this
sensory
experience
is
not
part
of
dream
Lastly
images
of
dreams
must
be
result
of
lasting
impressions
of
waking
sensory
experiences

Aristotelian
just
war
theory
is
not
well
regarded
in
present
day
especially
his
view
that
warfare
was
justified
to
enslave
natural
slaves
In
Aristotelian
philosophy
abolition
of
what
he
considers
natural
slavery
would
undermine
civic
freedom
The
pursuit
of
freedom
is
inseparable
from
pursuing
mastery
over
those
who
deserve
to
be
slaves
According
to
The
Cambridge
Companion
to
Aristotles
Politics
targets
of
this
aggressive
warfare
were
nonGreeks
noting
Aristotles
view
that
our
poets
say
it
is
proper
for
Greeks
to
rule
nonGreeks
Aristotle
generally
has
favourable
opinion
of
war
extolling
it
as
chance
for
virtue
and
writing
that
leisure
that
accompanies
peace
tends
to
make
people
arrogant
War
to
avoid
becoming
enslaved
to
others
is
justified
as
selfdefence
He
writes
that
war
compels
people
to
be
just
and
temperate
however
in
order
to
be
just
war
must
be
chosen
for
sake
of
peace
with
exception
of

of
aggression

Ethics
Main
article
Aristotelian
ethics
Aristotle
considered
ethics
to
be
practical
rather
than
theoretical
study
ie
one
aimed
at
becoming
good
and
doing
good
rather
than
knowing
for
its
own
sake
He
wrote
several
treatises
on
ethics
including
most
notably
Nicomachean
Ethics
Aristotle
taught
that
virtue
has
to
do
with
proper
function
ergon
of
thing
An
eye
is
only
good
eye
in
so
much
as
it
can
see
because
proper
function
of
eye
is
sight
Aristotle
reasoned
that
humans
must
have
function
specific
to
humans
and
that
this
function
must
be
activity
of
psuch
soul
in
accordance
with
reason
logos
Aristotle
identified
such
optimum
activity
virtuous
mean
between
accompanying
vices
of
excess
or
deficiency
of
soul
as
aim
of
all
human
deliberate
action
eudaimonia
generally
translated
as
happiness
or
sometimes
well
being
To
have
potential
of
ever
being
happy
in
this
way
necessarily
requires
good
character
thik
aret
often
translated
as
moral
or
ethical
virtue
or
excellence
Aristotle
taught
that
to
achieve
virtuous
and
potentially
happy
character
requires
first
stage
of
having
fortune
to
be
habituated
not
deliberately
but
by
teachers
and
experience
leading
to
later
stage
in
which
one
consciously
chooses
to
do
best
things
When
best
people
come
to
live
life
this
way
their
practical
wisdom
phronesis
and
their
intellect

Politics
Aristotle
In
addition
to
his
works
on
ethics
which
address
individual
Aristotle
addressed
city
in
his
work
titled
Politics
Aristotle
considered
city
to
be
natural
community
Moreover
he
considered
city
to
be
prior
in
importance
to
family
which
in
turn
is
prior
to
individual
for
whole
must
of
necessity
be
prior
to
part
He
famously
stated
that
man
is
by
nature
political
animal
and
argued
that
humanitys
defining
factor
among
others
in
animal
kingdom
is
its
rationality
Aristotle
conceived
of
politics
as
being
like
organism
rather
than
like
machine
and
as
collection
of
parts
none
of
which
can
exist
without
others
Aristotles
conception
of
city
is
organic
and
he
is
considered
one
of
first
to
conceive
of
city
in
this
manner
Aristotles
classifications
of
political
constitutions
The
common
modern
understanding
of
political
community
as
modern
state
is
quite
different
from
Aristotles
understanding
Although
he
was
aware
of
existence
and
potential
of
larger
empires
natural
community
according
to
Aristotle
was
city
polis
which
functions
as
political
community
or
partnership
koinnia
The
aim
of
city
is
not
just
to
avoid
injustice
or
for
economic
stability
but
rather
to
allow
at
least
some
citizens
possibility
to
live
good
life
and
to
perform
beautiful
acts
The
political
partnership
must
be
regarded
therefore
as
being
for
sake
of
noble
actions
not
for
sake
of
living
together
This
is
distinguished
from
modern
approaches
beginning
with
social
contract
theory
according
to
which
individuals
leave
state
of
nature
because
of
fear
of
violent
death
or
its
inconveniencesL
In
Protrepticus
character
Aristotle
states
For
we
all
agree
that
most
excellent
man
should
rule
ie
supreme
by
nature
and
that
law
rules
and
alone
is
authoritative
but
law
is
kind
of
intelligence
ie
discourse
based
on
intelligence
And
again
what
standard
do
we
have
what
criterion
of
good
things
that
is
more
precise
than
intelligent
man
For
all
that
this
man
will
choose
if
choice
is
based
on
his
knowledge
are
good
things
and
their
contraries
are
bad
And
since
everybody
chooses
most
of
all
what
conforms
to
their
own
proper
dispositions
just
man
choosing
to
live
justly
man
with
bravery
to
live
bravely
likewise
selfcontrolled
man
to
live
with
selfcontrol
it
is
clear
that
intelligent
man
will
choose
most
of
all
to
be
intelligent
for
this
is
function
of
that
capacity
Hence
its
evident
that
according
to
most
authoritative
judgment
intelligence
is
supreme
among
goods
As
Platos
disciple
Aristotle
was
rather
skeptical
concerning
democracy
and
following
Platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
It
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
This
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as
oligarchy

Main

Politics
Aristotle
Aristotle
made
substantial
contributions
to
economic
thought
especially
to
thought
in
Middle
Ages
In
Politics
Aristotle
addresses
city
property
and
trade
His
response
to
criticisms
of
private
property
in
Lionel
Robbinss
view
anticipated
later
proponents
of
private
property
among
philosophers
and
economists
as
it
related
to
overall
utility
of
social
arrangements
Aristotle
believed
that
although
communal
arrangements
may
seem
beneficial
to
society
and
that
although
private
property
is
often
blamed
for
social
strife
such
evils
in
fact
come
from
human
nature
In
Politics
Aristotle
offers
one
of
earliest
accounts
of
origin
of
money
Money
came
into
use
because
people
became
dependent
on
one
another
importing
what
they
needed
and
exporting
surplus
For
sake
of
convenience
people
then
agreed
to
deal
in
something
that
is
intrinsically
useful
and
easily
applicable
such
as
iron
or
silver
Aristotles
discussions
on
retail
and
interest
was
major
influence
on
economic
thought
in
Middle
Ages
He
had
low
opinion
of
retail
believing
that
contrary
to
using
money
to
procure
things
one
needs
in
managing
household
retail
trade
seeks
to
make
profit
It
thus
uses
goods
as
means
to
end
rather
than
as
end
unto
itself
He
believed
that
retail
trade
was
in
this
way
unnatural
Similarly
Aristotle
considered
making
profit
through
interest
unnatural
as
it
makes
gain
out
of
money
itself
and
not
from
its
use
Aristotle
gave
summary
of
function
of
money
that
was
perhaps
remarkably
precocious
for
his
time
He
wrote
that
because
it
is
impossible
to
determine
value
of
every
good
through
count
of
number
of
other
goods
it
is
worth
necessity
arises
of
single
universal
standard
of
measurement
Money
thus
allows
for
association
of
different
goods
and
makes
them
commensurable
He
goes
on
to
state
that
money
is
also
useful
for
future
exchange
making
it
sort
of
security
That
is
if
we
do
not
want
thing
now
we
shall
be
able
to
get
it
when
we
do
want
it

Rhetoric
Aristotle
and
Poetics
Aristotle
The
Blind
Oedipus
Commending
his
Children
to
Gods
by
Bnigne
Gagneraux
In
his
Poetics
Aristotle
uses
tragedy
Oedipus
Tyrannus
by
Sophocles
as
example
of
how
perfect
tragedy
should
be
structured
with
generally
good
protagonist
who
starts
play
prosperous
but
loses
everything
through
some
hamartia
fault
Aristotles
Rhetoric
proposes
that
speaker
can
use
three
basic
kinds
of
appeals
to
persuade
his
audience
ethos
appeal
to
speakers
character
pathos
appeal
to
audiences
emotion
and
logos
appeal
to
logical
reasoning
He
also
categorizes
rhetoric
into
three
genres
epideictic
ceremonial
speeches
dealing
with
praise
or
blame
forensic
judicial
speeches
over
guilt
or
innocence
and
deliberative
speeches
calling
on
audience
to
make
decision
on
issue
Aristotle
also
outlines
two
kinds
of
rhetorical
proofs
enthymeme
proof
by
syllogism
and
paradeigma
proof
by
example
Aristotle
writes
in
his
Poetics
that
epic
poetry
tragedy
comedy
dithyrambic
poetry
painting
sculpture
music
and
dance
are
all
fundamentally
acts
of
mimesis
imitation
each
varying
in
imitation
by
medium
object
and
manner
He
applies
term
mimesis
both
as
property
of
work
of
art
and
also
as
product
of
artists
intention
and
contends
that
audiences
realisation
of
mimesis
is
vital
to
understanding
work
itself
Aristotle
states
that
mimesis
is
natural
instinct
of
humanity
that
separates
humans
from
animals
and
that
all
human
artistry
follows
pattern
of
nature
Because
of
this
Aristotle
believed
that
each
of
mimetic
arts
possesses
what
Stephen
Halliwell
calls
highly
structured
procedures
for
achievement
of
their
purposes
For
example
music
imitates
with
media
of
rhythm
and
harmony
whereas
dance
imitates
with
rhythm
alone
and
poetry
with
language
The
forms
also
differ
in
their
object
of
imitation
Comedy
for
instance
is
dramatic
imitation
of
men
worse
than
average
whereas
tragedy
imitates
men
slightly
better
than
average
Lastly
forms
differ
in
their
manner
of
imitation
through
narrative
or
character
through
change
or
no
change
and
through
drama
or
no
drama
While
it
is
believed
that
Aristotles
Poetics
originally
comprised
two
books
one
on
comedy
and
one
on
tragedy
only
portion
that
focuses
on
tragedy
has
survived
Aristotle
taught
that
tragedy
is
composed
of
six
elements
plotstructure
character
style
thought
spectacle
and
lyric
poetry
The
characters
in
tragedy
are
merely
means
of
driving
story
and
plot
not
characters
is
chief
focus
of
tragedy
Tragedy
is
imitation
of
action
arousing
pity
and
fear
and
is
meant
to
effect
catharsis
of
those
same
emotions
Aristotle
concludes
Poetics
with
discussion
on
which
if
either
is
superior
epic
or
tragic
mimesis
He
suggests
that
because
tragedy
possesses
all
attributes
of
epic
possibly
possesses
additional
attributes
such
as
spectacle
and
music
is
more
unified
and
achieves
aim
of
its
mimesis
in
shorter
scope
it
can
be
considered
superior
to
epic
Aristotle
was
keen
systematic
collector
of
riddles

and

and

More
than
years
after

Aristotle
remains
one
of
most
influential
people
who
ever
lived
He
contributed
to
almost
every
field
of
human
knowledge
then
in

and
he
was
founder
of
many
new
fields
According

During
th
century
Aristotles
work
was
widely
criticized
The
philosopher
Bertrand
Russell
argued
that
almost
every
serious
intellectual
advance
has
had
to
begin
with
attack
on
some
Aristotelian
doctrine
Russell
called
Aristotles
ethics
repulsive
and
labelled
his
logic
as
definitely
antiquated
as
Ptolemaic
astronomy
Russell
stated
that
these
errors
made
it
difficult
to
do
historical
justice
to
Aristotle
until
one
remembered
what
advance
he
made
upon
all
of
his
predecessors
The
Dutch
historian
of
science
Eduard
Jan
Dijksterhuis
wrote
that
Aristotle
and
his
predecessors
showed
difficulty
of
science
by
proceeding
so
readily
to
frame
theory
of
such
general
character
on
limited
evidence
from
their
senses
In
biologist
Peter
Medawar
could
still
state
in
pure
seventeenth
century
tones
that
Aristotle
had
assembled
strange
and
generally
speaking
rather
tiresome
farrago
of
hearsay
imperfect
observation
wishful
thinking
and
credulity
amounting
to
downright
gullibility
By
start
of
st
century
however
Aristotle
was
taken
more
seriously
Kukkonen
noted
that
In
best
thcentury
scholarship
Aristotle
comes
alive

wrestling
with
full
weight
of
Greek
philosophical
tradition
Alasdair
MacIntyre
has
attempted
to
reform
what
he
calls
Aristotelian
tradition
in
way
that
is
antielitist
and
capable
of
disputing
claims

both
liberals
and

how

Andronicus

which
existed
in

separate

distinguished
them
from

Atene
is
fresco
by
Italian
Renaissance
artist
Raphael
It
was
painted
between
and
as
part
of
Raphaels
commission
to
decorate
rooms
now
known
as
Stanze
di
Raffaello
in
Apostolic
Palace
in
Vatican
The
Stanza
della
Segnatura
The
Stanza
della
Segnatura
was
first
of
rooms
to
be
decorated
and
The
School
of
Athens
representing
philosophy
was
probably
third
painting
to
be
finished
there
after
La
Disputa
Theology
on
opposite
wall
and
Parnassus
Literature
The
painting
is
notable
for
its
accurate
perspective
projection
which
Raphael
learned
from
Leonardo
da
Vinci
who
is
central
figure
of
this
painting
representing
Plato
The
rebirth
of
Ancient
Greek
Philosophy
and
culture
in
Europe
along
with
Raphaels
work
were
inspired
by
Leonardos
individual
pursuits
in
theatre
engineering
optics
geometry
physiology
anatomy
history
architecture
and
art
This
work
has
long
been
seen
as
Raphaels
masterpiece
and
perfect
embodiment
of
classical
spirit
of
Renaissance

The
School
of
Athens
is
one
of
group
of
four
main
frescoes
on
walls
of
Stanza
those
on
either
side
centrally
interrupted
by
windows
that
depict
distinct
branches
of
knowledge
Each
theme
is
identified
above
by
separate
tondo
containing
majestic
female
figure
seated
in
clouds
with
putti
bearing
phrases
Seek
Knowledge
of
Causes
Divine
Inspiration
Knowledge
of
Things
Divine
Disputa
To
Each
What
Is
Due
Accordingly
figures
on
walls
below
exemplify
philosophy
poetry
including
music
theology
and
law
The
traditional
title
is
not
Raphaels
The
subject
of
painting
is
actually
philosophy
or
at
least
ancient
Greek
philosophy
and
its
overhead
tondolabel
Causarum
Cognitio
tells
us
what
kind
as
it
appears
to
echo
Aristotles
emphasis
on
wisdom
as
knowing
why
hence
knowing
causes
in
Metaphysics
Book
I
and
Physics
Book
II
Indeed
Plato
and
Aristotle
appear
to
be
central
figures
in
scene
However
many
of
philosophers
depicted
sought
knowledge
of
first
causes
Many
lived
before
Plato
and
Aristotle
and
hardly
third
were
Athenians
The
architecture
contains
Roman
elements
but
general
semicircular
setting
having
Plato
and
Aristotle
at
its
centre
might
be
alluding
to
Pythagoras
monad
Bramante
as
Euclid
Zoroaster
Ptolemy
Raphael
as
Apelles
and
Perugino
Il
Sodoma
or
Timoteo
Viti
as
Protogenes
Commentators
have
suggested
that
nearly
every
great
ancient
Greek
philosopher
can
be
found
in
painting
but
determining
which
are
depicted
is
speculative
since
Raphael
made
no
designations
outside
possible
likenesses
and
no
contemporary
documents
explain
painting
Compounding
problem
Raphael
had
to
invent
system
of
iconography
to
allude
to
various
figures
for
whom
there
were
no
traditional
visual
types
For
example
while
Socrates
figure
is
immediately
recognizable
from
Classical
busts
one
of
figures
alleged
to
be
Epicurus
is
far
removed
from
his
standard
depiction
Aspects
of
fresco
other
than
identities
of
figures
have
also
been
variously
interpreted
but
few
such
interpretations
are
unanimously
accepted
among
scholars
That
rhetorical
gestures
of
Plato
and
Aristotle
are
kinds
of
pointing
to
heavens
and
down
to
earth
is
popularly
accepted
as
likely
However
Platos
Timaeus
which
is
book
Raphael
places
in
his
hand
was
sophisticated
treatment
of
space
time
and
change
including
Earth
which
guided
mathematical
sciences
for
over
millennium
Aristotle
with
his
fourelements
theory
held
that
all
change
on
Earth
was
owing
to
motions
of
heavens
In
painting
Aristotle
carries
his
Ethics
which
he
denied
could
be
reduced
to
mathematical
science
It
is
not
certain
how
much
young
Raphael
knew
of
ancient
philosophy
what
guidance
he
might
have
had
from
people
such
as
Bramante
and
whether
detailed
program
was
dictated
by
his
sponsor
Pope
Julius
II
Nevertheless
fresco
has
even
recently
been
interpreted
as
exhortation
to
philosophy
and
in
deeper
way
as
visual
representation
of
role
of
Love
in
elevating
people
toward
upper
knowledge
largely
in
consonance
with
contemporary
theories
of
Marsilio
Ficino
and
other
neoPlatonic
thinkers
linked
to
Raphael
Finally
according
to
Giorgio
Vasari
scene
includes
Raphael
himself
Duke
of
Mantua
Zoroaster
and
some
Evangelists
However
to
Heinrich
Wlfflin
it
is
quite
wrong
to
attempt
interpretations
of
School
of
Athens
as
esoteric
treatise
The
allimportant
thing
was
artistic
motive
which
expressed
physical
or
spiritual
state
and
name
of
person
was
matter
of
indifference
in
Raphaels
time
Raphaels
artistry
then
orchestrates
beautiful
space
continuous
with
that
of
viewers
in
Stanza
in
which
great
variety
of
human
figures
each
one
expressing
mental
states
by
physical
actions
interact
in
polyphony
unlike
anything
in
earlier
art
in
ongoing
dialogue
of
Philosophy
An
interpretation
of
fresco
relating
to
hidden
symmetries
of
figures
and
star
constructed
by
Bramante
was
given
by
Guerino
Mazzola
and
collaborators
The
main
basis
are
two
mirrored
triangles
on
drawing
from
Bramante
Euclid
which
correspond
to
feet
positions
of
certain
figures
Figuresedit
The
identities
of
some
of
philosophers
in
picture
such
as
Plato
and
Aristotle
are
certain
Beyond
that
identifications
of
Raphaels
figures
have
always
been
hypothetical
To
complicate
matters
beginning
from
Vasaris
efforts
some
have
received
multiple
identifications
not
only
as
ancients
but
also
as
figures
contemporary
with
Raphael
Vasari
mentions
portraits
of
young
Federico
II

Central
figures
and
edit
An
elder
Plato
walks
alongside
younger
Aristotle
In
center
of
fresco
at
its
architectures
central
vanishing
point
are
two
undisputed
main
subjects
Plato
on
left
and
Aristotle
his
student
on
right
Both
figures
hold
modern
of
time
bound
copies
of
their
books
in
their
left
hands
while
gesturing
with
their
right
Plato
holds
Timaeus
and
Aristotle
holds
his
Nicomachean
Ethics
Plato
is
depicted
as
old
grey
and
barefoot
By
contrast
Aristotle
slightly
ahead
of
him
is
in
mature
manhood
wearing
sandals
and
goldtrimmed
robes
and
youth
about
them
seem
to
look
his
way
In
addition
these
two
central
figures
gesture
along
different
dimensions
Plato
vertically
upward
along
pictureplane
into
vault
above
Aristotle
on
horizontal
plane
at
rightangles
to
pictureplane
hence
in
strong
foreshortening
initiating
flow
of
space
toward
viewers
It
is
popularly
thought
that
their
gestures
indicate
central
aspects
of
their
philosophies
for
Plato
his
Theory
of
Forms
and
for
Aristotle
emphasis
on
concrete
particulars
Many
interpret
painting
to
show
divergence
of
two
philosophical
schools
Plato
argues
sense
of
timelessness
whilst
Aristotle
looks
into
physicality
of
life
and
present
realm
Settingedit
Detail
of
architecture
The
building
is
in
shape
of
Greek
cross
which
some
have
suggested
was
intended
to
show
harmony
between
pagan
philosophy
and
Christian
theology
see
Christianity
and
Paganism
and
Christian
philosophy
The
architecture
of
building
was
inspired
by
work
of
Bramante
who
according
to
Vasari
helped
Raphael
with
architecture
in
picture
The
resulting
architecture
was
similar
to
then
new
St
Peters
Basilica
There
are
two
sculptures
in
background
The
one
on
left
is
god
Apollo
god
of
light
archery
and
music
holding
lyre
The
sculpture
on
right
is
Athena
goddess
of
wisdom
in
her
Roman
guise
as
Minerva
The
main
arch
above
characters
shows
meander
also
known
as
Greek
fret
or
Greek
key
design
design
using
continuous
lines
that
repeat
in
series
of
rectangular
bends
which
originated
on
pottery
of
Greek
Geometric
period
and
then
become
widely
used
in
ancient
Greek
architectural
friezes

A

April
known
as
Raphael
was
Italian
painter
and
architect
of
High
Renaissance
His
work
is
admired
for
its
clarity
of
form
ease
of
composition
and
visual
achievement
of
Neoplatonic
ideal
of
human
grandeur
Together
with
Michelangelo
and
Leonardo
da
Vinci
he
forms
traditional
trinity
of
great
masters
of
that
period
Raphael
was
enormously
productive
running
unusually
large
workshop
and
despite
his
early
death
at
leaving
large
body
of
work
Many
of
his
works
are
found
in
Vatican
Palace
where
frescoed
Raphael
Rooms
were
central
and
largest
work
of
his
career
The
best
known
work
is
The
School
of
Athens
in
Vatican
Stanza
della
Segnatura
After
his
early
years
in
Rome
much
of
his
work
was
executed
by
his
workshop
from
his
drawings
with
considerable
loss
of
quality
He
was
extremely
influential
in
his
lifetime
though
outside
Rome
his
work
was
mostly
known
from
his
collaborative
printmaking
Raphael
The
School
of
Athens
After
his
death
influence
of
his
great
rival
Michelangelo
was
more
widespread
until
th
and
th
centuries
when
Raphaels
more
serene
and
harmonious
qualities
were
again
regarded
as
highest
models
His
career
falls
naturally
into
three
phases
and
three
styles
first
described
by
Giorgio
Vasari
his
early
years
in
Umbria
then
period
of
about
four
years
absorbing
artistic
traditions
of
Florence
followed
by
his
last
hectic
and
triumphant
twelve
years
in
Rome
working
for
two
Popes
and
their
close
associates
His
father
was
court
painter
to
ruler
of
small
but
highly
cultured
city
of
Urbino
He
died
when
Raphael
was
eleven
and
Raphael
seems
to
have
played
role
in
managing
family
workshop
from
this
point
He
trained
in
workshop
of
Perugino
and
was
described
as
fully
trained
master

He
worked
in

for
several
cities
in
north
Italy
until
in
he
moved
to
Rome
at
invitation
of
pope
to
work
on
Vatican
Palace
He
was
given
series
of
important
commissions
there
and
elsewhere
in

to
work

Background
Giovanni
Santi
Raphaels
father
Christ
supported
by
two
angels
c
Raphael
was
born
in
small
but
artistically
significant
central
Italian
city
of
Urbino
in
Marche
region
where
his
father
Giovanni
Santi
was
court
painter
to
Duke
The
reputation
of
court
had
been
established
by
Federico
da
Montefeltro
highly
successful
condottiere
who
had
been
created
Duke
of
Urbino
by
Pope
Sixtus
IV
Urbino
formed
part
of
Papal
States
and
who
died
year
before
Raphael
was
born
The
emphasis
of
Federicos
court
was
more
literary
than
artistic
but
Giovanni
Santi
was
poet
of
sorts
as
well
as
painter
and
had
written
rhymed
chronicle
of
life
of
Federico
and
both
wrote
texts
and
produced
decor
for
masquelike
court
entertainments
His
poem
to
Federico
shows
him
as
keen
to
demonstrate
awareness
of
most
advanced
North
Italian
painters
and
Early
Netherlandish
artists
as
well
In
very
small
court
of
Urbino
he
was
probably
more
integrated
into
central
circle
of
ruling
family
than
most
court
painters
Federico
was
succeeded
by
his
son
Guidobaldo
da
Montefeltro
who
married
Elisabetta
Gonzaga
daughter
of
ruler
of
Mantua
most
brilliant
of
smaller
Italian
courts
for
both
music
and
visual
arts
Under
them
court
continued
as
centre
for
literary
culture
Growing
up
in
circle
of
this
small
court
gave
Raphael
excellent
manners
and
social
skills
stressed
by
Vasari
Court
life
in
Urbino
at
just
after
this
period
was
to
become
set
as
model
of
virtues
of
Italian
humanist
court
through
Baldassare
Castigliones
depiction
of
it
in
his
classic
work
The
Book
of
Courtier
published
in
Castiglione
moved
to
Urbino
in
when
Raphael
was
no
longer
based
there
but
frequently
visited
and
they
became
good
friends
Raphael
became
close
to
other
regular
visitors
to
court
Pietro
Bibbiena
and
Pietro
Bembo
both
later
cardinals
were
already
becoming
well
known
as
writers
and
would
later
be
in
Rome
during
Raphaels
period
there
Raphael
mixed
easily
in
highest
circles
throughout
his
life
one
of
factors
that
tended
to
give
misleading
impression
of
effortlessness
to
his
career
He
did
not
receive
full
humanistic
education
however
it
is
unclear
how
easily
he
read

and

Portrait

Duke

c
Uffizi
Gallery
Raphaels
mother
Mgia
died
in
when
he
was
eight
followed
on
August
by
his
father
who
had
already
remarried
Raphael
was
thus
orphaned
at
eleven
his
formal
guardian
became
his
only
paternal
uncle
Bartolomeo
priest
who
subsequently
engaged
in
litigation
with
his
stepmother
He
probably
continued
to
live
with
his
stepmother
when
not
staying
as
apprentice
with
master
He
had
already
shown
talent
according
to
Vasari
who
says
that
Raphael
had
been
great
help
to
his
father
A
selfportrait
drawing
from
his
teenage
years
shows
his
precocity
His
fathers
workshop
continued
and
probably
together
with
his
stepmother
Raphael
evidently
played
part
in
managing
it
from
very
early
age
In
Urbino
he
came
into
contact
with
works
of
Paolo
Uccello
previously
court
painter
d
and
Luca
Signorelli
who
until
was
based
in
nearby
Citt
di
Castello
According
to
Vasari
his
father
placed
him
in
workshop
of
Umbrian
master
Pietro
Perugino
as
apprentice
despite
tears
of
his
motherb
The
evidence
of
apprenticeship
comes
only
from
Vasari
and
another
source
and
has
been
disputed
eight
was
very
early
for
apprenticeship
to
begin
An
alternative
theory
is
that
he
received
at
least
some
training
from
Timoteo
Viti
who
acted
as
court
painter
in
Urbino
from
Most
modern
historians
agree
that
Raphael
at
least
worked
as
assistant
to
Perugino
from
around
influence
of
Perugino
on
Raphaels
early
work
is
very
clear
probably
no
other
pupil
of
genius
has
ever
absorbed
so
much
of
his
masters
teaching
as
Raphael
did
according
to
Wlfflin
Vasari
wrote
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
between
their
hands
at
this
period
but
many
modern
art
historians
claim
to
do
better
and
detect
his
hand
in
specific
areas
of
works
by
Perugino
or
his
workshop
Apart
from
stylistic
closeness
their
techniques
are
very
similar
as
well
for
example
having
paint
applied
thickly
using
oil
varnish
medium
in
shadows
and
darker
garments
but
very
thinly
on
flesh
areas
An
excess
of
resin
in
varnish
often
causes
cracking
of
areas
of
paint
in
works
of
both
masters
The
Perugino
workshop
was
active
in
both
Perugia
and
Florence
perhaps
maintaining
two
permanent
branches
Raphael
is
described
as
master
that
is
to
say
fully
trained
in
December
His
first
documented
work
was
Baronci
altarpiece
for
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
of
Tolentino
in
Citt
di
Castello
town
halfway
between
Perugia
and
Urbino
Evangelista
da
Pian
di
Meleto
who
had
worked
for
his
father
was
also
named
in
commission
It
was
commissioned
in
and
finished
in
now
only
some
cut
sections
and
preparatory
drawing
remain
In
following
years
he
painted
works
for
other
churches
there
including
Mond
Crucifixion
about
and
Brera
Wedding
of
Virgin
and
for
Perugia
such
as
Oddi
Altarpiece
He
very
probably
also
visited
Florence
in
this
period
These
are
large
works
some
in
fresco
where
Raphael
confidently
marshals
his
compositions
in
somewhat
static
style
of
Perugino
He
also
painted
many
small
and
exquisite
cabinet
paintings
in
these
years
probably
mostly
for
connoisseurs
in
Urbino
court
like
Three
Graces
and
St
Michael
and
he
began
to
paint
Madonnas
and
portraits
In
he
went
to
Siena
at
invitation
of
another
pupil
of
Perugino
Pinturicchio
being
friend
of
Raphael
and
knowing
him
to
be
draughtsman
of
highest
quality
to
help
with
cartoons
and
very
likely
designs
for
fresco
series
in
Piccolomini
Library
in
Siena
Cathedral
He
was
evidently
already
much
in
demand
even
at
this
early
stage
in
his
career

Raphael
led
nomadic
life
working
in
various
centres
in
Northern
Italy
but
spent
good
deal
of
time
in
Florence
perhaps
from
about
Although
there
is
traditional
reference
to
Florentine
period
of
about
he
was
possibly
never
continuous
resident
there
He
may
have
needed
to
visit
city
to
secure
materials
in
any
case
There
is
letter
of
recommendation
of
Raphael
dated
October
from
mother
of
next
Duke
of
Urbino
to
Gonfaloniere
of
Florence
The
bearer
of
this
will
be
found
to
be
Raphael
painter
of
Urbino
who
being
greatly
gifted
in
his
profession
has
determined
to
spend
some
time
in
Florence
to
study
And
because
his
father
was
most
worthy
and
I
was
very
attached
to
him
and
son
is
sensible
and
wellmannered
young
man
on
both
accounts
I
bear
him
great
love
As
earlier
with
Perugino
and
others
Raphael
was
able
to
assimilate
influence
of
Florentine
art
whilst
keeping
his
own
developing
style
Frescos
in
Perugia
of
about
show
new
monumental
quality
in
figures
which
may
represent
influence
of
Fra
Bartolomeo
who
Vasari
says
was
friend
of
Raphael
But
most
striking
influence
in
work
of
these
years
is
Leonardo
da
Vinci
who
returned
to
city
from
to
Raphaels
figures
begin
to
take
more
dynamic
and
complex
positions
and
though
as
yet
his
painted
subjects
are
still
mostly
tranquil
he
made
drawn
studies
of
fighting
nude
men
one
of
obsessions
of
period
in
Florence
Another
drawing
is
portrait
of
young
woman
that
uses
threequarter
length
pyramidal
composition
of
justcompleted
Mona
Lisa
but
still
looks
completely
Raphaelesque
Another
of
Leonardos
compositional
inventions
pyramidal
Holy
Family
was
repeated
in
series
of
works
that
remain
among
his
most
famous
easel
paintings
There
is
drawing
by
Raphael
in
Royal
Collection
of
Leonardos
lost
Leda
and
Swan
from
which
he
adapted
contrapposto
pose
of
his
own
Saint
Catherine
of
Alexandria
He
also
perfects
his
own
version
of
Leonardos
sfumato
modelling
to
give
subtlety
to
his
painting
of
flesh
and
develops
interplay
of
glances
between
his
groups
which
are
much
less
enigmatic
than
those
of
Leonardo
But
he
keeps
soft
clear
light
of
Perugino
in
his
paintings
Leonardo
was
more
than
thirty
years
older
than
Raphael
but
Michelangelo
who
was
in
Rome
for
this
period
was
just
eight
years

senior
Michelangelo
already
disliked
Leonardo
and
in
Rome
came
to
dislike
Raphael
even
more
attributing
conspiracies
against
him
to
younger
man
Raphael
would
have
been
aware
of
his
works
in
Florence
but
in
his
most
original
work
of
these
years
he
strikes
out
in
different
direction
His
Deposition
of
Christ
draws
on
classical
sarcophagi
to
spread
figures
across
front
of
picture
space
in
complex
and
not
wholly
successful
arrangement
Wllflin
detects

but
rest
of
composition
is
far
removed
from
his
style
or
that

Leonardo
Though
highly
regarded
at
time
and
much
later
forcibly
removed
from
Perugia
by
Borghese
it
stands
rather
alone
in

work

take

Roman
period
Vatican
Stanze
In
Raphael
moved
to
Rome
where
he
resided
for
rest
of
his
life
He
was
invited
by
new
pope
Julius
II
perhaps
at
suggestion
of
his
architect
Donato
Bramante
then
engaged
on
St
Peters
Basilica
who
came
from
just
outside
Urbino
and
was
distantly
related
to
Raphael
Unlike
Michelangelo
who
had
been
kept
lingering
in
Rome
for
several
months
after
his
first
summons
Raphael
was
immediately
commissioned
by
Julius
to
fresco
what
was
intended
to
become
Popes
private
library
at
Vatican
Palace
This
was
much
larger
and
more
important
commission
than
any
he
had
received
before
he
had
only
painted
one
altarpiece
in
Florence
itself
Several
other
artists
and
their
teams
of
assistants
were
already
at
work
on
different
rooms
many
painting
over
recently
completed
paintings
commissioned
by
Juliuss
loathed
predecessor
Alexander
VI
whose
contributions
and
arms
Julius
was
determined
to
efface
from
palace
Michelangelo
meanwhile
had
been
commissioned
to
paint
Sistine
Chapel
ceiling
The
Parnassus
Stanza
della
Segnatura
This
first
of
famous
Stanze
or
Raphael
Rooms
to
be
painted
now
known
as
Stanza
della
Segnatura
after
its
use
in
Vasaris
time
was
to
make
stunning
impact
on
Roman
art
and
remains
generally
regarded
as
his
greatest
masterpiece
containing
The
School
of
Athens
The
Parnassus
and
Disputa
Raphael
was
then
given
further
rooms
to
paint
displacing
other
artists
including
Perugino
and
Signorelli
He
completed
sequence
of
three
rooms
each
with
paintings
on
each
wall
and
often
ceilings
too
increasingly
leaving
work
of
painting
from
his
detailed
drawings
to
large
and
skilled
workshop
team
he
had
acquired
who
added
fourth
room
probably
only
including
some
elements
designed
by
Raphael
after
his
early
death
in
The
death
of
Julius
in
did
not
interrupt
work
at
all
as
he
was
succeeded
by
Raphaels
last
Pope
Medici
Pope
Leo
X
with
whom
Raphael
formed
even
closer
relationship
and
who
continued
to
commission
him
Raphaels
friend
Cardinal
Bibbiena
was
also
one
of
Leos
old
tutors
and
close
friend
and
advisor
Raphael
was
clearly
influenced
by
Michelangelos
Sistine
Chapel
ceiling
in
course
of
painting
room
Vasari
said
Bramante
let
him
in
secretly
The
first
section
was
completed
in
and
reaction
of
other
artists
to
daunting
force
of
Michelangelo
was
dominating
question
in
Italian
art
for
following
few
decades
Raphael
who
had
already
shown
his
gift
for
absorbing
influences
into
his
own
personal
style
rose
to
challenge
perhaps
better
than
any
other
artist
One
of
first
and
clearest
instances
was
portrait
in
The
School
of
Athens
of
Michelangelo
himself
as
Heraclitus
which
seems
to
draw
clearly
from
Sybils
and
ignudi
of
Sistine
ceiling
Other
figures
in
that
and
later
paintings
in
room
show
same
influences
but
as
still
cohesive
with
development
of
Raphaels
own
style
Michelangelo
accused
Raphael
of
plagiarism
and
years
after
Raphaels
death
complained
in
letter
that
everything
he
knew
about
art
he
got
from
me
although
other
quotations
show
more
generous
reactions
These
very
large
and
complex
compositions
have
been
regarded
ever
since
as
among
supreme
works
of
grand
manner
of
High
Renaissance
and
classic
art
of
postantique
West
They
give
highly
idealised
depiction
of
forms
represented
and
compositions
though
very
carefully
conceived
in
drawings
achieve
sprezzatura
term
invented
by
his
friend
Castiglione
who
defined
it
as
certain
nonchalance
which
conceals
all
artistry
and
makes
whatever
one
says
or
does
seem
uncontrived
and
effortless
According
to
Michael
Levey
Raphael
gives
his
figures
superhuman
clarity
and
grace
in
universe
of
Euclidian
certainties
The
painting
is
nearly
all
of
highest
quality
in
first
two
rooms
but
later
compositions
in
Stanze
especially
those
involving
dramatic
action
are
not
entirely
as
successful
either
in
conception
or
their
execution

Architecture
Palazzo
Branconio
dellAquila
now
destroyed
After
Bramantes
death
in
Raphael
was
named
architect
of
new
St
Peters
Most
of
his
work
there
was
altered
or
demolished
after
his
death
and
acceptance
of
Michelangelos
design
but
few
drawings
have
survived
It
appears
his
designs
would
have
made
church
good
deal
gloomier
than
final
design
with
massive
piers
all
way
down
nave
like
alley
according
to
critical
posthumous
analysis
by
Antonio
da
Sangallo
Younger
It
would
perhaps
have
resembled
temple
in
background
of
The
Expulsion
of
Heliodorus
from
Temple
He
designed
several
other
buildings
and
for
short
time
was
most
important
architect
in
Rome
working
for
small
circle
around
Papacy
Julius
had
made
changes
to
street
plan
of
Rome
creating
several
new
thoroughfares
and
he
wanted
them
filled
with
splendid
palaces
An
important
building
Palazzo
Branconio
dellAquila
for
Leos
Papal
Chamberlain
Giovanni
Battista
Branconio
was
completely
destroyed
to
make
way
for
Berninis
piazza
for
St
Peters
but
drawings
of
faade
and
courtyard
remain
The
faade
was
unusually
richly
decorated
one
for
period
including
both
painted
panels
on
top
story
of
three
and
much
sculpture
on
middle
one
The
main
designs
for
Villa

were
not
by
Raphael
but
he
did
design
and
decorate
with

Another
building

this

He

Even
incomplete
it

yet
seen
in

greatly
influenced
later
development
of

it

to

Only

he
was
accumulating

in
his
last
years
It
was

Antiquity
In
about
Raphael
was
asked
by
Bramante
to
judge
contemporary
copies
of
Laocon
and
His
Sons
In
he
was
given
powers
as
Prefect
over
all
antiquities
unearthed
within
or
mile
outside
city
Anyone
excavating
antiquities
was
required
to
inform
Raphael
within
three
days
and
stonemasons
were
not
allowed
to
destroy
inscriptions
without
permission
Raphael
wrote
letter
to
Pope
Leo
suggesting
ways
of
halting
destruction
of
ancient
monuments
and
proposed
visual
survey
of
city
to
record
all
antiquities
in
organised
fashion
The
pope
intended
to
continue
to
reuse
ancient
masonry
in
building
of
St
Peters
also
wanting
to
ensure
that
all
ancient
inscriptions
were
recorded
and
sculpture
preserved
before
allowing
stones
to
be
reused
According
to
Marino
Sanuto
Youngers
diary
in
Raphael
offered
to
transport
obelisk
from
Mausoleum
of
August
to
St
Peters
Square
for
ducats
According
to
Marcantonio
Michiel
Raphaels
youthful
death
saddened
men
of
letters
because
he
was
not
able
to
furnish
description
and
painting
of
ancient
Rome
that
he
was
making
which
was
very
beautiful
Raphael
intended
to
make

of

this
was
never
executed

took

he
painted
several
portraits
including
those
of
his
two
main
patrons

Julius
II
and
his

former
considered
one
of
his
finest
Other
portraits
were
of
his
own
friends
like
Castiglione
or
immediate
Papal
circle
Other
rulers
pressed
for
work
and
King
Francis
I
of
France
was
sent
two
paintings
as
diplomatic
gifts
from
Pope
For
Agostino
Chigi
hugely
rich
banker
and
papal
treasurer
he
painted
Triumph
of
Galatea
and
designed
further
decorative
frescoes
for
his
Villa
Farnesina
chapel
in
church
of
Santa
Maria
della
Pace
and
mosaics
in
funerary
chapel
in

Maria
del
Popolo
He
also
designed
some
of
decoration
for
Villa
Madama
work
in
both
villas
being
executed
by
his

One
of
his
most
important

which
seven
survive

for

The
cartoons
were
sent
to
Brussels
to
be
woven
in

van
Aelst
It
is
possible
that
Raphael
saw
finished

also
designed

Workshop
Vasari
says
that
Raphael
eventually
had
workshop
of
fifty
pupils
and
assistants
many
of
whom
later
became
significant
artists
in
their
own
right
This
was
arguably
largest
workshop
team
assembled
under
any
single
old
master
painter
and
much
higher
than
norm
They
included
established
masters
from
other
parts
of
Italy
probably
working
with
their
own
teams
as
subcontractors
as
well
as
pupils
and
journeymen
We
have
very
little
evidence
of
internal
working
arrangements
of
workshop
apart
from
works
of
art
themselves
which
are
often
very
difficult
to
assign
to
particular
hand
The
most
important
figures
were
Giulio
Romano
young
pupil
from
Rome
only
about
twentyone
at
Raphaels
death
and
Gianfrancesco
Penni
already
Florentine
master
They
were
left
many
of
Raphaels
drawings
and
other
possessions
and
to
some
extent
continued
workshop
after
Raphaels
death
Penni
did
not
achieve
personal
reputation
equal
to
Giulios
as
after
Raphaels
death
he
became
Giulios
lessthanequal
collaborator
in
turn
for
much
of
his
subsequent
career
Perino
del
Vaga
already
master
and
Polidoro
da
Caravaggio
who
was
supposedly
promoted
from
labourer
carrying
building
materials
on
site
also
became
notable
painters
in
their
own
right
Polidoros
partner
Maturino
da
Firenze
has
like
Penni
been
overshadowed
in
subsequent
reputation
by
his
partner
Giovanni
da
Udine
had
more
independent
status
and
was
responsible
for
decorative
stucco
work
and
grotesques
surrounding
main
frescoes
Most
of
artists
were
later
scattered
and
some
killed
by
violent
Sack
of
Rome
in
This
did
however
contribute
to
diffusion
of
versions
of
Raphaels
style
around
Italy
and
beyond
Vasari
emphasises
that
Raphael
ran
very
harmonious
and
efficient
workshop
and
had
extraordinary
skill
in
smoothing
over
troubles
and
arguments
with
both
patrons
and
his
assistants
contrast
with
stormy
pattern
of
Michelangelos
relationships
with
both
However
though
both
Penni
and
Giulio
were
sufficiently
skilled
that
distinguishing
between
their
hands
and
that
of
Raphael
himself
is
still
sometimes
difficult
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
of
Raphaels
later
wallpaintings
and
probably
some
of
his
easel
paintings
are
more
notable
for
their
design
than
their
execution
Many
of
his
portraits
if
in
good
condition
show
his
brilliance
in
detailed
handling
of
paint
right
up
to
end
of
his
life

Drawings
Lucretia
engraved
by
Raimondi
after
drawing
by
Raphael
Raphael
was
one
of
finest
draftsmen
in
history
of
Western
art
and
used
drawings
extensively
to
plan
his
compositions
According
to
nearcontemporary
when
beginning
to
plan
composition
he
would
lay
out
large
number
of
stock
drawings
of
his
on
floor
and
begin
to
draw
rapidly
borrowing
figures
from
here
and
there
Over
forty
sketches
survive
for
Disputa
in
Stanze
and
there
may
well
have
been
many
more
originally
over
four
hundred
sheets
survive
altogether
He
used
different
drawings
to
refine
his
poses
and
compositions
apparently
to
greater
extent
than
most
other
painters
to
judge
by
number
of
variants
that
survive
This
is
how
Raphael
himself
who
was
so
rich
in
inventiveness
used
to
work
always
coming
up
with
four
or
six
ways
to
show
narrative
each
one
different
from
rest
and
all
of
them
full
of
grace
and
well
done
wrote
another
writer
after
his
death
For
John
Shearman
Raphaels
art
marks
shift
of
resources
away
from
production
to
research
and
development
When
final
composition
was
achieved
scaledup
fullsize
cartoons
were
often
made
which
were
then
pricked
with
pin
and
pounced
with
bag
of
soot
to
leave
dotted
lines
on
surface
as
guide
He
also
made
unusually
extensive
use
on
both
paper
and
plaster
of
blind
stylus
scratching
lines
which
leave
only
indentation
but
no
mark
These
can
be
seen
on
wall
in
The
School
of
Athens
and
in
originals
of
many
drawings
The
Raphael
Cartoons
as
tapestry
designs
were
fully
coloured
in
glue
distemper
medium
as
they
were
sent
to
Brussels
to
be
followed
by
weavers
In
later
works
painted
by
workshop
drawings
are
often
painfully
more
attractive
than
paintings
Most
Raphael
drawings
are
rather
preciseeven
initial
sketches
with
naked
outline
figures
are
carefully
drawn
and
later
working
drawings
often
have
high
degree
of
finish
with
shading
and
sometimes
highlights
in
white
They
lack
freedom
and
energy
of
some
of
Leonardos
and
Michelangelos
sketches
but
are
nearly
always
aesthetically
very
satisfying

Printmaking
Raphael
made
no
prints
himself
but
entered
into
collaboration
with
Marcantonio
Raimondi
to
produce
engravings
to
Raphaels
designs
which
created
many
of
most
famous
Italian
prints
of
century
and
was
important
in
rise
of
reproductive
print
His
interest
was
unusual
in
such
major
artist
from
his
contemporaries
it
was
only
shared
by
Titian
who
had
worked
much
less
successfully
with
Raimondi
A
total
of
about
fifty
prints
were
made
some
were
copies
of
Raphaels
paintings
but
other
designs
were
apparently
created
by
Raphael
purely
to
be
turned
into
prints
Raphael
made
preparatory
drawings
many
of
which
survive
for
Raimondi
to
translate
into
engraving
The
most
famous
original
prints
to
result
from
collaboration
were
Lucretia
Judgement
of
Paris
and
The
Massacre
of
Innocents
of
which
two
virtually
identical
versions
were
engraved
Among
prints

The
Parnassus
with
considerable
differences
and

were
also
especially
well
known
Outside

La

Raphaels

From
until
his
death
Raphael
lived
in
Palazzo
Caprini
lying
at
corner
between
piazza
Scossacavalli
and
via
Alessandrina
in
Borgo
in
rather
grand
style
in
palace
designed
by
Bramante
He
never
married
but
in
became
engaged
to
Maria
Bibbiena
Cardinal
Medici
Bibbienas
niece
he
seems
to
have
been
talked
into
this
by
his
friend
cardinal
and
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
seems
to
be
shown
by
marriage
not
having
taken
place
before
she
died
in
He
is
said
to
have
had
many
affairs
but
permanent
fixture
in
his
life
in
Rome
was
La
Fornarina
Margherita
Luti
daughter
of
baker
fornaro
named
Francesco
Luti
from
Siena
who
lived
at
Via
del
Governo
Vecchio
He
was
made
Groom
of
Chamber
of
Pope
which
gave
him
status
at
court
and
additional
income
and
also
knight
of
Papal
Order
of
Golden
Spur
Vasari
claims
that
he
had
toyed
with
ambition
of
becoming
cardinal
perhaps
after
some
encouragement
from
Leo
which
also
may
account
for
his
delaying
his
marriage
Raphael
died
on
Good
Friday
April
which
was
possibly
his
th
birthdayd
Vasari
says
that
Raphael
had
also
been
born
on
Good
Friday
which
in
fell
on
March
e
and
that
artist
died
from
exhaustion
brought
on
by
unceasing
romantic
interests
while
he
was
working
on
Loggia
Several
other
possibilities
have
been
raised
by
later
historiansf
In
his
acute
illness
which
lasted
fifteen
days
Raphael
was
composed
enough
to
confess
his
sins
receive
last
rites
and
put
his
affairs
in
order
He
dictated
his
will
in
which
he
left
sufficient
funds
for
his
mistresss
care
entrusted
to
his
loyal
servant
Baviera
and
left
most
of
his
studio
contents
to
Giulio
Romano
and
Penni
At
his
request
Raphael
was
buried
in
Pantheon
Raphaels
funeral
was
extremely
grand
attended
by
large
crowds
According
to
journal
by
Paris

four
cardinals
dressed
in
purple

Sistine

Raphael
was
highly
admired
by
his
contemporaries
although
his
influence
on
artistic
style
in
his
own
century
was
less
than
that
of
Michelangelo
Mannerism
beginning
at
time
of
his
death
and
later
Baroque
took
art
in
direction
totally
opposed
to
Raphaels
qualities
with
Raphaels
death
classic
art
High
Renaissance
subsided
as
Walter
Friedlnder
put
it
He
was
soon
seen
as
ideal
model
by
those
disliking
excesses
of
Mannerism
opinion
was
generally
held
in
middle
of
sixteenth
century
that
Raphael
was
ideal
balanced
painter
universal
in
his
talent
satisfying
all
absolute
standards
and
obeying
all
rules
which
were
supposed
to
govern
arts
whereas
Michelangelo
was
eccentric
genius
more
brilliant
than
any
other
artists
in
his
particular
field
drawing
of
male
nude
but
unbalanced
and
lacking
in
certain
qualities
such
as
grace
and
restraint
essential
to
great
artist
Those
like
Dolce
and
Aretino
who
held
this
view
were
usually
survivors
of
Renaissance
Humanism
unable
to
follow
Michelangelo
as
he
moved
on
into
Mannerism
Vasari
himself
despite
his
hero
remaining
Michelangelo
came
to
see
his
influence
as
harmful
in
some
ways
and
added
passages
to
second
edition
of
Lives
expressing
similar
views
Raphael
and

Raphaels

Raphaels
compositions
were
always
admired
and
studied
and
became
cornerstone
of
training
of
Academies
of
art
His
period
of
greatest
influence
was
from
late
th
to
late
th
centuries
when
his
perfect
decorum
and
balance
were
greatly
admired
He
was
seen
as
best
model
for
history
painting
regarded
as
highest
in
hierarchy
of
genres
Sir
Joshua
Reynolds
in
his
Discourses
praised
his
simple
grave
and
majestic
dignity
and
said
he
stands
in
general
foremost
of
first
ie
best
painters
especially
for
his
frescoes
in
which
he
included
Raphael
Cartoons
whereas
Michael
Angelo
claims
next
attention
He
did
not
possess
so
many
excellences
as
Raffaelle
but
those
he
had
were
of
highest
kind
Echoing
sixteenthcentury
views
above
Reynolds
goes
on
to
say
of
Raphael
The
excellency
of
this
extraordinary
man
lay
in
propriety
beauty
and
majesty
of
his
characters
his
judicious
contrivance
of
his
composition
correctness
of
drawing
purity
of
taste
and
skilful
accommodation
of
other
mens
conceptions
to
his
own
purpose
Nobody
excelled
him
in
that
judgment
with
which
he
united
to
his
own
observations
on
nature
energy
of
Michael
Angelo
and
beauty
and
simplicity
of
antique
To
question
therefore
which
ought
to
hold
first
rank
Raffaelle
or
Michael
Angelo
it
must
be
answered
that
if
it
is
to
be
given
to
him
who
possessed
greater
combination
of
higher
qualities
of
art
than
any
other
man
there
is
no
doubt
but
Raffaelle
is
first
But
if
according
to
Longinus
sublime
being
highest
excellence
that
human
composition
can
attain
to
abundantly
compensates
absence
of
every
other
beauty
and
atones
for
all
other
deficiencies
then
Michael
Angelo
demands
preference
Reynolds
was
less
enthusiastic
about
Raphaels
panel
paintings
but
slight
sentimentality
of
these
made
them
enormously
popular
in
th
century
We
have
been
familiar
with
them
from
childhood
onwards
through
far
greater
mass
of
reproductions
than
any
other
artist
in
world
has
ever
had
wrote
Wlfflin
who
was
born
in
of
Raphaels
Madonnas
In
Germany
Raphael
had
immense
influence
on
religious
art
of
Nazarene
movement
and
Dsseldorf
school
of
painting
in
th
century
In
contrast
in
England
PreRaphaelite
Brotherhood
explicitly
reacted
against
his
influence
and
that
of
his
admirers
such
as
Joshua
Reynolds
seeking
to
return
to
styles
that
predated
what
they
saw
as
his
baneful
influence
According
to
critic
whose
ideas
greatly
influenced
them
John
Ruskin
The
doom
of
arts
of
Europe
went
forth
from
that
chamber
Stanza
della
Segnatura
and
it
was
brought
about
in
great
part
by
very
excellencies
of
man
who
had
thus
marked
commencement
of
decline
The
perfection
of
execution
and
beauty
of
feature
which
were
attained
in
his
works
and
in
those
of
his
great
contemporaries
rendered
finish
of
execution
and
beauty
of
form
chief
objects
of
all
artists
and
thenceforward
execution
was
looked
for
rather
than
thought
and
beauty
rather
than
veracity
And
as
I
told
you
these
are
two
secondary
causes
of
decline
of
art
first
being
loss
of
moral
purpose
Pray
note
them
clearly
In
medival
art
thought
is
first
thing
execution
second
in
modern
art
execution
is
first
thing
and
thought
second
And
again
in
medival
art
truth
is
first
beauty
second
in
modern
art
beauty
is
first
truth
second
The
medival
principles
led
up
to
Raphael
and
modern
principles
lead
down
from
him
By
Raphaels
popularity
was
surpassed
by
Michelangelo
and
Leonardo
perhaps
as
reaction
against
etiolated
Raphaelism
of
thcentury
academic
artists
such
as
Bouguereau
Although
art
historian
Bernard
Berenson
in
termed
Raphael
most
famous
and
most
loved
master
of
High
Renaissance
art
historians
Leopold
and
Helen
Ettlinger
say
that
Raphaels
lesser
popularity
in
th
century
is
made
obvious
by
contents
of
art
library
shelves
In
contrast
to
volume
upon
volume
that
reproduce
yet
again
detailed
photographs
of
Sistine
Ceiling
or
Leonardos
drawings
literature
on
Raphael
particularly
in
English
is
limited
to
only
few
books
They
conclude
nonetheless
that
of
all
great
Renaissance
masters
Raphaels
influence
is
most
continuous

He

to

but
is
stated
to
have
been

on

as

on

he
died
three
hours
after

Both

dates
cannot
be
true
After
visit
to
Verrocchios
workshop
Santi
recorded
that
both
Perugino
and
Leonardo
da
Vinci
were
present
and
seems
to
have
viewed
them
as
being
at
equivalent
skill
level
After

Raphaels
age
at
death
is
debated
by
some
with
Michiel
asserting
that
Raphael
died
at
while
Pandolfo
Pico
and
Girolamo
Lippomano
arguing
that
he
died
at
Whereas
Michiel
said
he
died
on
his
birthday
Art
historian
John
Shearman
addressed
this
apparent
discrepancy
The
time
of
death
can
be
calculated
from
convention
of
counting
from
sundown
which
Michaelis
puts
at
on
Friday
April
plus
halfhour
to
Ave
Maria
plus
three
hours
that
is
soon
after
pm
The
coincidence
noted
between
birthdate
and
deathdate
is
usually
thought
in
this
case
since
it
refers
to
Friday
and
Saturday
in
Holy
Week
movable
feast
rather
than
day
of
month
to
fortify
argument
that
Raphael
was
also
born
on

ie
March

there
is
notable
ambiguity
in
Michiels
note

Politeia

De
Republica
is
Socratic
dialogue
authored
by
Plato
around
BC
concerning
justice
order
and
character
of
just
citystate
and
just
man
It
is
Platos
bestknown
work
and
has
proven
to
be
one
of
worlds
most
influential
works
of
philosophy
and
political
theory
both
intellectually
and
historically
In
dialogue
Socrates
talks
with
various
Athenians
and
foreigners
about
meaning
of
justice
and
whether
just
man
is
happier
than
unjust
man
They
consider
natures
of
existing
regimes
and
then
propose
series
of
different
hypothetical
cities
in
comparison
culminating
in
Kallipolis
utopian
citystate
ruled
by
philosopherking
They
also
discuss
theory
of
forms
immortality
of
soul
and
role
of
philosopher
and
of
poetry
in
society
The
dialogues
setting
seems
to
be

While
visiting
Piraeus
with
Glaucon
Polemarchus
tells
Socrates
to
join
him
for
romp
Socrates
then
asks
Cephalus
Polemarchus
and
Thrasymachus
their
definitions
of
justice
Cephalus
defines
justice
as
giving
what
is
owed
Polemarchus
says
justice
is
art
which
gives
good
to
friends
and
evil
to
enemies
Thrasymachus
proclaims
justice
is
nothing
else
than
interest
of
stronger
Socrates
overturns
their
definitions
and
says
that
it
is
to
ones
advantage
to
be
just
and
disadvantage
to
be
unjust
The
first
book
ends
in
aporia
concerning
its
essence
Book
IIedit
Socrates
believes
he
has
answered
Thrasymachus
and
is
done
with
discussion
of
justice
Socrates
young
companions
Glaucon
and
Adeimantus
continue
argument
of
Thrasymachus
for
sake
of
furthering
discussion
Glaucon
gives
lecture
in
which
he
argues
first
that
origin
of
justice
was
in
social
contracts
aimed
at
preventing
one
from
suffering
injustice
and
being
unable
to
take
revenge
second
that
all
those
who
practice
justice
do
so
unwillingly
and
out
of
fear
of
punishment
and
third
that
life
of
unjust
man
is
far
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
Glaucon
would
like
Socrates
to
prove
that
justice
is
not
only
desirable
but
that
it
belongs
to
highest
class
of
desirable
things
those
desired
both
for
their
own
sake
and
their
consequences
To
demonstrate
problem
he
tells
story
of
Gyges
who
with
help
of
ring
that
turns
him
invisible
achieves
great
advantages
for
himself
by
committing
injustices
After
Glaucons
speech
Adeimantus
adds
that
in
this
thought
experiment
unjust
should
not
fear
any
sort
of
divine
judgement
in
afterlife
since
very
poets
who
wrote
about
such
judgement
also
wrote
that
gods
would
grant
forgiveness
to
those
humans
who
made
ample
religious
sacrifice
Adeimantus
demonstrates
his
reason
by
drawing
two
detailed
portraits
that
unjust
man
could
grow
wealthy
by
injustice
devoting
percentage
of
this
gain
to
religious
losses
thus
rendering
him
innocent
in
eyes
of
gods
Socrates
suggests
that
they
look
for
justice
in
city
rather
than
in
individual
man
After
attributing
origin
of
society
to
individual
not
being
selfsufficient
and
having
many
needs
which
he
cannot
supply
himself
they
go
on
to
describe
development
of
city
Socrates
first
describes
healthy
state
but
Glaucon
asks
him
to
describe
city
of
pigs
as
he
finds
little
difference
between
two
He
then
goes
on
to
describe
luxurious
city
which
he
calls
fevered
state
This
requires
guardian
class
to
defend
and
attack
on
its
account
This
begins
discussion
concerning
type
of
education
that
ought
to
be
given
to
these
guardians
in
their
early
years
including
topic
of
what
kind
of
stories
are
appropriate
They
conclude
that
stories
that
ascribe
evil
to
gods
are
untrue
and
should
not
be
taught
Book
IIIedit
Socrates
and
his
companions
Adeimantus
and
Glaucon
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
education
Socrates
breaks
educational
system
into
two
They
suggest
that
guardians
should
be
educated
in
these
four
virtues
wisdom
courage
justice
and
temperance
They
also
suggest
that
second
part
of
guardians
education
should
be
in
gymnastics
With
physical
training
they
will
be
able
to
live
without
needing
frequent
medical
attention
physical
training
will
help
prevent
illness
and
weakness
Socrates
asserts
that
both
male
and
female
guardians
be
given
same
education
that
all
wives
and
children
be
shared
and
that
they
be
prohibited
from
owning
private
property
Book
IVedit
Socrates
and
his
companions
conclude
their
discussion
concerning
lifestyle
of
guardians
thus
concluding
their
initial
assessment
of
city
as
whole
Socrates
assumes
each
person
will
be
happy
engaging
in
occupation
that
suits
them
best
If
city
as
whole
is
happy
then
individuals
are
happy
In
physical
education
and
diet
of
guardians
emphasis
is
on
moderation
since
both
poverty
and
excessive
wealth
will
corrupt
them
a
Without
controlling
their
education
city
cannot
control
future
rulers
Socrates
says
that
it
is
pointless
to
worry
over
specific
laws
like
those
pertaining
to
contracts
since
proper
education
ensures
lawful
behavior
and
poor
education
causes
lawlessness
ac
Socrates
proceeds
to
search
for
wisdom
courage
and
temperance
in
city
on
grounds
that
justice
will
be
easier
to
discern
in
what
remains
e
They
find
wisdom
among
guardian
rulers
courage
among
guardian
warriors
or
auxiliaries
temperance
among
all
classes
of
city
in
agreeing
about
who
should
rule
and
who
should
be
ruled
Finally
Socrates
defines
justice
in
city
as
state
in
which
each
class
performs
only
its
own
work
not
meddling
in
work
of
other
classes
b
The
virtues
discovered
in
city
are
then
sought
in
individual
soul
For
this
purpose
Socrates
creates
analogy
between
parts
of
city
and
soul
citysoul
analogy
He
argues
that
psychological
conflict
points
to
divided
soul
since
completely
unified
soul
could
not
behave
in
opposite
ways
towards
same
object
at
same
time
and
in
same
respect
b
He
gives
examples
of
possible
conflicts
between
rational
spirited
and
appetitive
parts
of
soul
corresponding
to
rulers
auxiliaries
and
producing
classes
in
city
Having
established
tripartite
soul
Socrates
defines
virtues
of
individual
A
person
is
wise
if
he
is
ruled
by
part
of
soul
that
knows
what
is
beneficial
for
each
part
and
for
whole
courageous
if
his
spirited
part
preserves
in
midst
of
pleasures
and
pains
decisions
reached
by
rational
part
and
temperate
if
three
parts
agree
that
rational
part
lead
cd
They
are
just
if
each
part
of
soul
attends
to
its
function
and
not
function
of
another
It
follows
from
this
definition
that
one
cannot
be
just
if
one
doesnt
have
other
cardinal
virtues
Book
Vedit
Socrates
having
to
his
satisfaction
defined
just
constitution
of
both
city
and
psyche
moves
to
elaborate
upon
four
unjust
constitutions
of
these
Adeimantus
and
Polemarchus
interrupt
asking
Socrates
instead
first
to
explain
how
sharing
of
wives
and
children
in
guardian
class
is
to
be
defined
and
legislated
theme
first
touched
on
in
Book
III
Socrates
is
overwhelmed
at
their
request
categorizing
it
as
three
waves
of
attack
against
which
his
reasoning
must
stand
firm
These
three
waves
challenge
Socrates
claims
that
both
male
and
female
guardians
ought
to
receive
same
education
human
reproduction
ought
to
be
regulated
by
state
and
all
offspring
should
be
ignorant
of
their
actual
biological
parents
such
city
and
its
corresponding
philosopherking
could
actually
come
to
be
in
real
world
Book
VIedit
Socrates
argument
is
that
in
ideal
city
true
philosopher
with
understanding
of
forms
will
facilitate
harmonious
cooperation
of
all
citizens
of
city
governance
of
citystate
is
likened
to
command
of
ship
Ship
of
State
This
philosopherking
must
be
intelligent
reliable
and
willing
to
lead
simple
life
However
these
qualities
are
rarely
manifested
on
their
own
and
so
they
must
be
encouraged
through
education
and
study
of
Good
Just
as
visible
objects
must
be
illuminated
in
order
to
be
seen
so
must
also
be
true
of
objects
of
knowledge
if
light
is
cast
on
them
Book
VIIedit
Socrates
elaborates
upon
immediately
preceding
Analogies
of
Sun
and
of
Divided
Line
in
Allegory
of
Cave
in
which
he
insists
that
psyche
must
be
freed
from
bondage
to
visiblesensible
world
by
making
painful
journey
into
intelligible
world
He
continues
in
rest
of
this
book
by
further
elaborating
upon
curriculum
which
wouldbe
philosopherking
must
study
This
is
origin
of
quadrivium
arithmetic
geometry
astronomy
and
music
Next
they
elaborate
on
education
of
philosopherking
Until
age
wouldbe
guardians
should
be
engaged
in
basic
intellectual
study
and
physical
training
followed
by
two
years
of
military
training
However
correction
is
then
introduced
where
study
of
gymnastics
martial
arts
and
warfare
plus
years
respectively
are
supplanted
by
philosophy
for
years
instead
Next
they
receive
ten
years
of
mathematics
until
age
and
then
five
years
of
dialectic
training
Guardians
then
spend
next
years
as
leaders
trying
to
lead
people
from

Upon
reaching
they
are
fully
aware
of
form
of

and
totally
mature
and
ready

Book
VIIIedit
Socrates
discusses
four
unjust
constitutions
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
He
argues
that
society
will
decay
and
pass
through
each
government
in
succession
eventually
becoming
tyranny
most
unjust
regime
of
all
The
starting
point
is
imagined
alternate
aristocracy
ruled
by
philosopherking
just
government
dominated
by
wisdomloving
element
When
its
social
structure
breaks
down
and
enters
civil
war
it
is
replaced
by
timocracy
The
timocratic
government
is
dominated
by
spirited
element
with
ruling
class
of
propertyowners
consisting
of
warriors
or
generals
Ancient
Sparta
is
example
As
emphasis
on
honor
is
compromised
by
wealth
accumulation
it
is
replaced
by
oligarchy
The
oligarchic
government
is
dominated
by
desiring
element
in
which
rich
are
ruling
class
The
gap
between
rich
and
poor
widens
culminating
in
revolt
by
underclass
majority
establishing
democracy
Democracy
emphasizes
maximum
freedom
so
power
is
distributed
evenly
It
is
also
dominated
by
desiring
element
but
in
undisciplined
unrestrained
way
The
populism
of
democratic
government
leads
to
mob
rule
fueled
by
fear
of
oligarchy
which
clever
demagogue
can
exploit
to
take
power
and
establish
tyranny
In
tyrannical
government
city
is
enslaved
to
tyrant
who
uses
his
guards
to
remove
best
social
elements
and
individuals
from
city
to
retain
power
since
they
pose
threat
while
leaving
worst
He
will
also
provoke
warfare
to
consolidate
his
position
as
leader
In
this
way
tyranny
is
most
unjust
regime
of
all
In
parallel
to
this
Socrates
considers
individual
or
soul
that
corresponds
to
each
of
these
regimes
He
describes
how
aristocrat
may
become
weak
or
detached
from
political
and
material
affluence
and
how
his
son
will
respond
to
this
by
becoming
overly
ambitious
The
timocrat
in
turn
may
be
defeated
by
courts
or
vested
interests
his
son
responds
by
accumulating
wealth
in
order
to
gain
power
in
society
and
defend
himself
against
same
predicament
thereby
becoming
oligarch
The
oligarchs
son
will
grow
up
with
wealth
without
having
to
practice
thrift
or
stinginess
and
will
be
tempted
and
overwhelmed
by
his
desires
so
that
he
becomes
democratic
valuing
freedom
above
all
Book
IXedit
Having
discussed
tyrannical
constitution
of
city
Socrates
wishes
to
discuss
tyrannical
constitution
of
psyche
This
is
all
intended
to
answer
Thrasymachus
first
argument
in
Book
I
that
life
of
unjust
man
here
understood
as
true
tyrant
is
more
blessed
than
that
of
just
man
philosopherking
First
he
describes
how
tyrannical
man
develops
from
democratic
household
The
democratic
man
is
torn
between
tyrannical
passions
and
oligarchic
discipline
and
ends
up
in
middle
ground
valuing
all
desires
both
good
and
bad
The
tyrant
will
be
tempted
in
same
way
as
democrat
but
without
upbringing
in
discipline
or
moderation
to
restrain
him
Therefore
his
most
base
desires
and
wildest
passions
overwhelm
him
and
he
becomes
driven
by
lust
using
force
and
fraud
to
take
whatever
he
wants
The
tyrant
is
both
slave
to
his
lusts
and
master
to
whomever
he
can
enslave
Because
of
this
tyranny
is
regime
with
least
freedom
and
happiness
and
tyrant
is
most
unhappy
of
all
since
regime
and
soul
correspond
His
desires
are
never
fulfilled
and
he
always
must
live
in
fear
of
his
victims
Because
tyrant
can
only
think
in
terms
of
servant
and
master
he
has
no
equals
whom
he
can
befriend
and
with
no
friends
tyrant
is
robbed
of
freedom
This
is
first
proof
that
it
is
better
to
be
just
than
unjust
The
second
proof
is
derived
from
tripartite
theory
of
soul
The
wisdomloving
soul
is
best
equipped
to
judge
what
is
best
through
reason
and
wise
individual
judges
wisdom
to
be
best
then
honor
then
desire
This
is
just
proportion
for
city
or
soul
and
stands
opposite
to
tyranny
which
is
entirely
satiated
on
base
desires
The
third
proof
follows
from
this
He
describes
how
soul
can
be
misled
into
experiencing
false
pleasure
for
example
lack
of
pain
can
seem
pleasurable
by
comparison
to
worse
state
True
pleasure
is
had
by
being
fulfilled
by
things
that
fit
ones
nature
Wisdom
is
most
fulfilling
and
is
best
guide
so
only
way
for
three
drives
of
soul
to
function
properly
and
experience
truest
pleasure
is
by
allowing
wisdom
to
lead
To
conclude
third
proof
wisdom
element
is
best
at
providing
pleasure
while
tyranny
is
worst
because
it
is
furthest
removed
from
wisdom
Finally
Socrates
considers
multiple
of
how
much
worse
tyranny
is
than
kinglydisciplinedwise
temperament
and
even
quantifies
tyrant
as
living
times
more
painfullyless
joyfully
than
king
He
then
gives
example
of
chimera
to
further
illustrate
justice
and
tripartite
soul
The
discussion
concludes
by
refuting
Thrasymachus
argument
and
designating
most
blessed
life
as
that
of
just
man
and
most
miserable
life
as
that
of
unjust
man
Book
Xedit
Concluding
theme
brought
up
most
explicitly
in
Analogies
of
Sun
and
Divided
Line
in
Book
VI
Socrates
finally
rejects
any
form
of
imitative
art
and
concludes
that
such
artists
have
no
place
in
just
city
He
continues
on
to
argue
for
immortality
of
psyche
and
even
espouses
theory
of
reincarnation
He
finishes
by
detailing
rewards
of
being
just
both
in
this
life
and
next
Artists
create
things
but
they
are
only
different
copies
of
idea
of
original
And
whenever
any
one
informs
us
that
he
has
found
man
who
knows
all
arts
and
all
things
else
that
anybody
knows
and
every
single
thing
with
higher
degree
of
accuracy
than
any
other
manwhoever
tells
us
this
I
think
that
we
can
only
imagine
to
be
simple
creature
who
is
likely
to
have
been
deceived
by
some
wizard
or
actor
whom
he
met
and
whom
he
thought
allknowing
because
he
himself
was
unable
to
analyze
nature
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
and
imitation
And
same
object
appears
straight
when
looked
at
out
of
water
and
crooked
when
in
water
and
concave
becomes
convex
owing
to
illusion
about
colours
to
which
sight
is
liable
Thus
every
sort
of
confusion
is
revealed
within
us
and
this
is
that
weakness
of
human
mind
on
which
art
of
conjuring
and
deceiving
by
light
and
shadow
and
other
ingenous
devices
imposes
having
effect
upon
us
like
magic
He
speaks
about
illusions
and
confusion
Things
can
look
very
similar
but
be
different
in
reality
Because
we
are
human
at
times
we
cannot
tell
difference
between
two
And
does
not
same
hold
also
of
ridiculous
There
are
jests
which
you
would
be
ashamed
to
make
yourself
and
yet
on

or
indeed
in

when
you
hear
them
you
are
greatly
amused
by
them
and
are
not
at

disgusted
at
their
unseemliness
case
of
pity

is
principle
in
human
nature
which
is
disposed
to
raise
laugh

this
which
you
once

you
were
afraid
of
being

buffoon

out
again
and

Topicsedit
Definition
of
justiceedit
In
first
book
two
definitions
of
justice
are
proposed
but
deemed
inadequate
Returning
debts
owed
and
helping
friends
while
harming
enemies
are
commonsense
definitions
of
justice
that
Socrates
shows
are
inadequate
in
exceptional
situations
and
thus
lack
rigidity
demanded
of
definition
Yet
he
does
not
completely
reject
them
for
each
expresses
commonsense
notion
of
justice
that
Socrates
will
incorporate
into
his
discussion
of
just
regime
in
books
II
through
V
At
end
of
Book
I
Socrates
agrees
with
Polemarchus
that
justice
includes
helping
friends
but
says
just
man
would
never
do
harm
to
anybody
Thrasymachus
believes
that
Socrates
has
done
men
present
injustice
by
saying
this
and
attacks
his
character
and
reputation
in
front
of
group
partly
because
he
suspects
that
Socrates
himself
does
not
even
believe
harming
enemies
is
unjust
Thrasymachus
gives
his
understanding
of
justice
and
injustice
as
justice
is
what
is
advantageous
to
stronger
while
injustice
is
to
ones
own
profit
and
advantage
Socrates
finds
this
definition
unclear
and
begins
to
question
Thrasymachus
Socrates
then
asks
whether
ruler
who
makes
mistake
by
making
law
that
lessens
their
wellbeing
is
still
ruler
according
to
that
definition
Thrasymachus
agrees
that
no
true
ruler
would
make
such
error
This
agreement
allows
Socrates
to
undermine
Thrasymachus
strict
definition
of
justice
by
comparing
rulers
to
people
of
various
professions
Thrasymachus
consents
to
Socrates
assertion
that
artist
is
someone
who
does
his
job
well
and
is
knower
of
some
art
which
allows
him
to
complete
job
well
In
so
doing
Socrates
gets
Thrasymachus
to
admit
that
rulers
who
enact
law
that
does
not
benefit
them
firstly
are
in
precise
sense
not
rulers
Thrasymachus
gives
up
and
is
silent
from
then
on
Socrates
has
trapped
Thrasymachus
into
admitting
strong
man
who
makes
mistake
is
not
strong
man
in
precise
sense
and
that
some
type
of
knowledge
is
required
to
rule
perfectly
However
it
is
far
from
satisfactory
definition
of
justice
At
beginning
of
Book
II
Platos
two
brothers
challenge
Socrates
to
define
justice
in
man
and
unlike
rather
short
and
simple
definitions
offered
in
Book
I
their
views
of
justice
are
presented
in
two
independent
speeches
Glaucons
speech
reprises
Thrasymachus
idea
of
justice
it
starts
with
legend
of
Gyges
who
discovered
ring
socalled
Ring
of
Gyges
that
gave
him
power
to
become
invisible
Glaucon
uses
this
story
to
argue
that
no
man
would
be
just
if
he
had
opportunity
of
doing
injustice
with
impunity
With
power
to
become
invisible
Gyges
is
able
to
seduce
queen
murder
king
and
take
over
kingdom
Glaucon
argues
that
just
as
well
as
unjust
man
would
do
same
if
they
had
power
to
get
away
with
injustice
exempt
from
punishment
The
only
reason
that
men
are
just
and
praise
justice
is
out
of
fear
of
being
punished
for
injustice
The
law
is
product
of
compromise
between
individuals
who
agree
not
to
do
injustice
to
others
if
others
will
not
do
injustice
to
them
Glaucon
says
that
if
people
had
power
to
do
injustice
without
fear
of
punishment
they
would
not
enter
into
such
agreement
Glaucon
uses
this
argument
to
challenge
Socrates
to
defend
position
that
just
life
is
better
than
unjust
life
Adeimantus
adds
to
Glaucons
speech
charge
that
men
are
only
just
for
results
that
justice
brings
one
fortune
honor
reputation
Adeimantus
challenges
Socrates
to
prove
that
being
just
is
worth
something
in
and
of
itself
not
only
as
means
to
end
Socrates
says
that
there
is
no
better
topic
to
debate
In
response
to
two
views
of
injustice
and
justice
presented
by
Glaucon
and
Adeimantus
he
claims
incompetence
but
feels
it
would
be
impious
to
leave
justice
in
such
doubt
Thus
Republic
sets
out
to
define
justice
Given
difficulty
of
this
task
as
proven
in
Book
I
Socrates
in
Book
II
leads
his
interlocutors
into
discussion
of
justice
in
city
which
Socrates
suggests
may
help
them
see
justice
not
only
in
person
but
on
larger
scale
first
in
cities
searching
for
what
it
is
then
thusly
we
could
examine
also
in
some
individual
examining
likeness
of
bigger
in
idea
of
littler
ea
For
over
two
and
half
millennia
scholars
have
differed
on
aptness
of
citysoul
analogy
Socrates
uses
to
find
justice
in
Books
II
through
V
The
Republic
is
dramatic
dialogue
not
treatise
Socrates
definition
of
justice
is
never
unconditionally
stated
only
versions
of
justice
within
each
city
are
found
and
evaluated
in
Books
II
through
Book
V
Socrates
constantly
refers
definition
of
justice
back
to
conditions
of
city
for
which
it
is
created
He
builds
series
of
myths
or
noble
lies
to
make
cities
appear
just
and
these
conditions
moderate
life
within
communities
The
earth
born
myth
makes
all
men
believe
that
they
are
born
from
earth
and
have
predestined
natures
within
their
veins
Accordingly
Socrates
defines
justice
as
working
at
that
to
which
he
is
naturally
best
suited
and
to
do
ones
own
business
and
not
to
be
busybody
ab
and
goes
on
to
say
that
justice
sustains
and
perfects
other
three
cardinal
virtues
Temperance
Wisdom
and
Courage
and
that
justice
is
cause
and
condition
of
their
existence
Socrates
does
not
include
justice
as
virtue
within
city
suggesting
that
justice
does
not
exist
within
human
soul
either
rather
it
is
result
of
well
ordered
soul
A
result
of
this
conception
of
justice
separates
people
into
three
types
that
of
soldier
that
of
producer
and
that
of
ruler
If
ruler
can
create
just
laws
and
if
warriors
can
carry
out
orders
of
rulers
and
if
producers
can
obey
this
authority
then
society
will
be
just
The
city
is
challenged
by
Adeimantus
and
Glaucon
throughout
its
development
Adeimantus
cannot
find
happiness
in
city
and
Glaucon
cannot
find
honor
and
glory
This
hypothetical
city
contains
no
private
property
no
marriage
or
nuclear
families
These
are
sacrificed
for
common
good
and
doing
what
is
best
fitting
to
ones
nature
In
Book
V
Socrates
addresses
question
of
naturalness
of
and
possibility
for
this
city
concluding
in
Book
VI
that
citys
ontological
status
regards
construction
of
soul
not
of
actual
metropolis
The
rule
of
philosopherkings
appear
as
issue
of
possibility
is
raised
Socrates
never
positively
states
what
justice
is
in
human
soulcity
it
appears
he
has
created
city
where
justice
is
not
found
but
can
be
lost
It
is
as
though
in
wellordered
state
justice
is
not
even
needed
since
community
satisfies
needs
of
humans
In
terms
of
why
it
is
best
to
be
just
rather
than
unjust
for
individual
Plato
prepares
answer
in
Book
IX
consisting
of
three
main
arguments
Plato
says
that
tyrants
nature
will
leave
him
with
horrid
pains
and
pangs
and
that
typical
tyrant
engages
in
lifestyle
that
will
be
physically
and
mentally
exacting
on
such
ruler
Such
disposition
is
in
contrast
to
truthloving
philosopherking
and
tyrant
never
tastes
of
true
freedom
or
friendship
The
second
argument
proposes
that
of
all
different
types
of
people
only
philosopher
is
able
to
judge
which
type
of
ruler
is
best
since
only
he
can
see
Form
of
Good
Thirdly
Plato
argues
Pleasures
which
are
approved
of
by
lover
of
wisdom
and
reason
are
truest
In
sum
Plato
argues
that
philosophical
pleasure
is
only
true
pleasure
since
other
pleasures
experienced
by
others
are
simply
neutral
state
free
of
pain
Socrates
points
out
human
tendency
to
be
corrupted
by
power
leads
down
road
to
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
From
this
he
concludes
that
ruling
should
be
left
to
philosophers
who
are
most
just
and
therefore
least
susceptible
to
corruption
This
good
city
is
depicted
as
being
governed
by
philosopherkings
disinterested
persons
who
rule
not
for
their
personal
enjoyment
but
for
good
of
citystate
polis
The
philosophers
have
seen
Forms
and
therefore
know
what
is
good
They
understand
corrupting
effect
of
greed
and
own
no
property
and
receive
no
salary
They
also
live
in
sober
communism
eating
and
sleeping
together
The
paradigmatic
society
which
stands
behind
every
historical
society
is
hierarchical
but
social
classes
have
marginal
permeability
there
are
no
slaves
no
discrimination
between
men
and
women
The
men
and
women
are
both
to
be
taught
same
things
so
they
are
both
able
to
be
used
for
same
things
e
In
addition
to
ruling
class
of
guardians
which
abolished
riches
there
is
class
of
private
producers
demiourgoi
who
may
be
rich
or
poor
A
number
of
provisions
aim
to
avoid
making
people
weak
substitution
of
universal
educational
system
for
men
and
women
instead
of
debilitating
music
poetry
and
theatre
startling
departure
from
Greek
society
These
provisions
apply
to
all
classes
and
restrictions
placed
on
philosopherkings
chosen
from
warrior
class
and
warriors
are
much
more
severe
than
those
placed
on
producers
because
rulers
must
be
kept
away
from
any
source
of
corruption
In
Books
VVI
abolition
of
riches
among
guardian
class
not
unlike
Max
Webers
bureaucracy
leads
controversially
to
abandonment
of
typical
family
and
as
such
no
child
may
know
his
or
her
parents
and
parents
may
not
know
their
own
children
Socrates
tells
tale
which
is
allegory
of
good
government
The
rulers
assemble
couples
for
reproduction
based
on
breeding
criteria
Thus
stable
population
is
achieved
through
eugenics
and
social
cohesion
is
projected
to
be
high
because
familial
links
are
extended
towards
everyone
in
city
Also
education
of
youth
is
such
that
they
are
taught
of
only
works
of
writing
that
encourage
them
to
improve
themselves
for
states
good
and
envision
gods
as
entirely
good
just
and
authors
of
only
that
which
is
good
In
Books
VIIX
stand
Platos
criticism
of
forms
of
government
It
begins
with
dismissal
of
timocracy
sort
of
authoritarian
regime
not
unlike
military
dictatorship
Plato
offers
almost
psychoanalytical
explanation
of
timocrat
as
one
who
saw
his
father
humiliated
by
his
mother
and
wants
to
vindicate
manliness
The
third
worst
regime
is
oligarchy
rule
of
small
band
of
rich
people
millionaires
that
only
respect
money
Then
comes
democratic
form
of
government
and
its
susceptibility
to
being
ruled
by
unfit
sectarian
demagogues
Finally
worst
regime
is
tyranny
where
whimsical
desires
of
ruler
became
law
and
there
is
no
check
upon
arbitrariness

Problem
of
universals
Allegory
of
Cave
and
Theory
of
Forms
The
Republic
contains
Platos
Allegory
of
Cave
with
which
he
explains
his
concept
of
Forms
as
answer
to
problem
of
universals
The
Allegory
of
Cave
primarily
depicts
Platos
distinction
between
world
of
appearances
and
real
world
of
Forms
as
well
as
helping
to
justify
philosophers
place
in
society
as
king
Plato
imagines
group
of
people
who
have
lived
their
entire
lives
as
prisoners
chained
to
wall
of
cave
in
subterranean
so
they
are
unable
to
see
outside
world
behind
them
However
constant
flame
illuminates
various
moving
objects
outside
which
are
silhouetted
on
wall
of
cave
visible
to
prisoners
These
prisoners
through
having
no
other
experience
of
reality
ascribe
forms
to
these
shadows
such
as
either
dog
or
cat
Plato
then
goes
on
to
explain
how
philosopher
is
akin
to
prisoner
who
is
freed
from
cave
The
prisoner
is
initially
blinded
by
light
but
when
he
adjusts
to
brightness
he
sees
fire
and
statues
and
how
they
caused
images
witnessed
inside
cave
He
sees
that
fire
and
statues
in
cave
were
just
copies
of
real
objects
merely
imitations
This
is
analogous
to
Forms
What
we
see
from
day
to
day
are
merely
appearances
reflections
of
Forms
The
philosopher
however
will
not
be
deceived
by
shadows
and
will
hence
be
able
to
see
real
world
world
above
that
of
appearances
philosopher
will
gain
knowledge
of
things
in
themselves
In
this
analogy
sun
is
representative
of
Good
This
is
main
object
of
philosophers
knowledge
The
Good
can
be
thought
of
as
form
of
Forms
or
structuring
of
world
as
whole
The
prisoners
stages
of
understanding
correlate
with
levels
on
divided
line
which
he
imagines
The
line
is
divided
into
what
visible
world
is
and
what
intelligible
world
is
with
divider
being
Sun
When
prisoner
is
in
cave
he
is
obviously
in
visible
realm
that
receives
no
sunlight
and
outside
he
comes
to
be
in
intelligible
realm
The
shadows
witnessed
in
cave
correspond
to
lowest
level
on
Platos
line
that
of
imagination
and
conjecture
Once
prisoner
is
freed
and
sees
shadows
for
what
they
are
he
reaches
second
stage
on
divided
line
stage
of
belief
for
he
comes
to
believe
that
statues
in
cave
are
real
On
leaving
cave
however
prisoner
comes
to
see
objects
more
real
than
statues
inside
of
cave
and
this
correlates
with
third
stage
on
Platos
line
thought
Lastly
prisoner
turns
to
sun
which
he
grasps
as
source
of
truth
or
Form
of
Good
and
this
last
stage
named
as
dialectic
is
highest
possible
stage
on
line
The
prisoner
as
result
of
Form
of
Good
can
begin
to
understand
all
other
forms
in
reality
At
end
of
this
allegory
Plato
asserts
that
it
is
philosophers
burden
to
reenter
cave
Those
who
have
seen
ideal
world
he
says
have
duty
to
educate
those
in
material
world
Since
philosopher
recognizes
what
is
truly
good
only
he
is
fit
to
rule
society

to
Plato

Main

Platos
five
regimes
While
Plato
spends
much
of
Republic
having
Socrates
narrate
conversation
about
city
he
founds
with
Glaucon
and
Adeimantus
in
speech
discussion
eventually
turns
to
considering
four
regimes
that
exist
in
reality
and
tend
to
degrade
successively
into
each
other
timocracy
oligarchy
also
called
plutocracy
democracy
and
tyranny
also
called
despotism
Timocracy
Socrates
defines
timocracy
as
government
of
people
who
love
rule
and
honor
Socrates
argues
that
timocracy
emerges
from
aristocracy
due
to
civil
war
breaking
out
among
ruling
class
and
majority
Over
time
many
more
births
will
occur
to
people
who
lack
aristocratic
guardian
qualities
slowly
drawing
populace
away
from
knowledge
music
poetry
and
guardian
education
toward
moneymaking
and
acquisition
of
possessions
This
civil
war
between
those
who
value
wisdom
and
those
who
value
material
acquisition
will
continue
until
compromise
is
reached
The
timocracy
values
war
insofar
as
it
satisfies
love
of
victory
and
honor
The
timocratic
man
loves
physical
training
and
hunting
and
values
his
abilities
in
warfare
Oligarchy
Temptations
create
confusion
between
economic
status
and
honor
which
is
responsible
for
emergence
of
oligarchy
In
Book
VIII
Socrates
suggests
that
wealth
will
not
help
pilot
to
navigate
his
ship
as
his
concerns
will
be
directed
centrally
toward
increasing
his
wealth
by
whatever
means
rather
than
seeking
out
wisdom
or
honor
The
injustice
of
economic
disparity
divides
rich
and
poor
thus
creating
environment
for
criminals
and
beggars
to
emerge
The
rich
are
constantly
plotting
against
poor
and
vice
versa
The
oligarchic
constitution
is
based
on
property
assessment
and
wealth
qualification
Unlike
timocracy
oligarchs
are
also

Democracy
As

divide
grows
so
do
tensions
between
social

From
conflicts
arising
out
of
such

poor

overthrow
wealthy
minority

democracy
replaces
oligarchy
preceding
it
The
poor
overthrow

peoples

no

Tyranny
The
excessive

granted
to

of

ultimately
leads
to
tyranny
furthest
regressed
type
of

These
freedoms
divide
people
into

elites
and
commoners
Tensions
between
dominating

and

cause
commoners
to
seek
out

of

They
invest
all
their

in
their

Reception
and
interpretationedit
Ancient
Greeceedit
The
idea
of
writing
treatises
on
systems
of
government
was
followed
some
decades
later
by
Platos
most
prominent
pupil
Aristotle
whose
Politika
systematises
many
of
Platos
concepts
in
some
cases
differing
from
his
conclusions
It
has
been
suggested
that
Isocrates
parodies
Republic
in
his
work
Busiris
by
showing
Callipolis
similarity
to
Egyptian
state
founded
by
king
of
that
name
Zeno
of
Citium
founder
of
Stoicism
wrote
his
version
of
ideal
society
Zenos
Republic
in
opposition
to
Platos
Republic
Zenos
Republic
was
controversial
and
was
viewed
with
some
embarrassment
by
some
of
later
Stoics
due
to
its
defenses
of
free
love
incest
and
cannibalism
and
due
to
its
opposition
to
ordinary
education
and
building
of
temples
lawcourts
and
gymnasia
Ancient
Romeedit
Ciceroedit
The
English
title
of
Platos
dialogue
is
derived
from
Ciceros
De
re

written
some
three
centuries
later
Ciceros
dialogue
imitates
Platos
style
and
treats
many
of
same
topics
and
Ciceros
main

Scipio
Aemilianus
expresses
his
esteem
for
Plato
and
Socrates
Res

Rather
politeia
is

for

and

forms
of
government
for
polis

to
survey

Tacitusedit
In
antiquity
Platos
works
were
largely
acclaimed
but
few
commentators
regarded
them
as
too
theoretical
Tacitus
commented
on
such
works
as
The
Republic
and
Aristotles
Politics
in
his
Annals

Indeed
nation
or
city
is
ruled
by
people
or
by
upper
class
or
by
monarch
A
government
system
that
is
invented
from
choice
of
these
same
components
is
sooner
idealised
than
realised
and
even
if
realised
there
will
be
no
future
for
it
In
this
work
Tacitus
undertakes
prosaic
description
and
minute
analysis
of
how
real
states
are
governed
attempting
to
derive
more
practical
lessons
about
good
versus
bad
governance
than
can
be
deduced
from
speculations
on
ideal
governments
Augustineedit
In
pivotal
era
of
Romes
move
from
its
ancient
polytheist
religion
to
Christianity
Augustine
wrote
his
magnum
opus
The
City
of
God
Again
references
to
Plato
Aristotle
and
Cicero
and
their
visions
of
ideal
state
were
legion
Augustine
equally
described
model
of
ideal
city
in
his
case
eternal
Jerusalem
using
visionary
language
not
unlike
that
of
preceding
philosophers
Islamedit
Islamic
philosophers
were
much
more
interested
in
Aristotle
than
Plato
but
not
having
access
to
Aristotles
Politics
Ibn
Rushd
Averroes
produced
instead
commentary
on
Platos
Republic
He
advances
authoritarian
ideal
following
Platos
paternalistic
model
Absolute
monarchy
led
by
philosopherking
creates
justly
ordered
society
This
requires
extensive
use
of
coercion
although
persuasion
is
preferred
and
is
possible
if
young
are
properly
raised
Rhetoric
not
logic
is
appropriate
road
to
truth
for
common
man
Demonstrative
knowledge
via
philosophy
and
logic
requires
special
study
Rhetoric
aids
religion
in
reaching
masses
Following
Plato
Ibn
Rushd
accepts
principle
of
womens
equality
They
should
be
educated
and
allowed
to
serve
in
military
best
among
them
might
be
tomorrows
philosophers
or
rulers
He
also
accepts
Platos
illiberal
measures
such
as
censorship
of
literature
He
uses
examples
from
Arab
history
to
illustrate
just
and
degenerate
political
orders
Hegeledit
Hegel
respected
Platos
theories
of
state
and
ethics
much
more
than
those
of
early
modern
philosophers
such
as
Locke
Hobbes
and
Rousseau
whose
theories
proceeded
from
fictional
state
of
nature
defined
by
humanitys
natural
needs
desires
and
freedom
For
Hegel
this
was
contradiction
since
nature
and
individual
are
contradictory
freedoms
which
define
individuality
as
such
are
latecomers
on
stage
of
history
Therefore
these
philosophers
unwittingly
projected
man
as
individual
in
modern
society
onto
primordial
state
of
nature
Plato
however
had
managed
to
grasp
ideas
specific
to
his
time
Plato
is
not
man
to
dabble
in
abstract
theories
and
principles
his
truthloving
mind
has
recognized
and
represented
truth
of
world
in
which
he
lived
truth
of
one
spirit
that
lived
in
him
as
in
Greece
itself
No
man
can
overleap
his
time
spirit
of
his
time
is
his
spirit
also
but
point
at
issue
is
to
recognize
that
spirit
by
its
content
For
Hegel
Platos
Republic
is
not
abstract
theory
or
ideal
which
is
too
good
for
real
nature
of
man
but
rather
is
not
ideal
enough
not
good
enough
for
ideals
already
inherent
or
nascent
in
reality
of
his
time
time
when
Greece
was
entering
decline
One
such
nascent
idea
was
about
to
crush
Greek
way
of
life
modern
freedomsor
Christian
freedoms
in
Hegels
viewsuch
as
individuals
choice
of
his
social
class
or
of
what
property
to
pursue
or
which
career
to
follow
Such
individual
freedoms
were
excluded
from
Platos
Republic
Plato
recognized
and
caught
up
true
spirit
of
his
times
and
brought
it
forward
in
more
definite
way
in
that
he
desired
to
make
this
new
principle

in
his
Republic
Greece
being
at

Platos
new
constitution
in
Republic
was
attempt
to
preserve
Greece
it
was
reactionary
reply
to
new
freedoms
of
private
property
etc
that
were
eventually
given
legal
form
through
Rome
Accordingly
in
ethical
life
it
was
attempt
to
introduce
religion
that
elevated
each
individual
not
as
owner
of
property
but
as
possessor
of
immortal
soul

Gadameredit
In
his
Plato
und
die
Dichter
Plato
and
Poets
as
well
as
several
other
works
HansGeorg
Gadamer
describes
utopic
city
of
Republic
as
heuristic
utopia
that
should
not
be
pursued
or
even
be
used
as
orientationpoint
for
political
development
Rather
its
purpose
is
said
to
be
to
show
how
things
would
have
to
be
connected
and
how
one
thing
would
lead
to
anotheroften
with
highly
problematic
resultsif
one
would
opt
for
certain
principles
and
carry
them
through
rigorously
This
interpretation
argues
that
large
passages
in
Platos
writing
are
ironic
line
of
thought
initially
pursued
by
Kierkegaard
Popperedit
The
city
portrayed
in
Republic
struck
some
critics
as
harsh
rigid
and
unfree
indeed
as
totalitarian
Karl
Popper
gave
voice
to
that
view
in
his
book
The
Open
Society
and
Its
Enemies
where
he
singled
out
Platos
state
as
dystopia
Popper
distinguished
Platos
ideas
from
those
of
Socrates
claiming
that
former
in
his
later
years
expressed
none
of
humanitarian
and
democratic
tendencies
of
his
teacher
Popper
thought
Platos
envisioned
state
totalitarian
as
it
advocated
government
composed
only
of
distinct
hereditary
ruling
class
with
working
class
who
Popper
argues
Plato
regards
as
human
cattle
given
no
role
in
decision
making
He
argues
that
Plato
has
no
interest
in
what
are
commonly
regarded
as
problems
of
justice
resolution
of
disputes
between
individuals
because
Plato
has
redefined
justice
as
keeping
ones
place

IIV
For
instance
there
is
evidence
in
dialogue
that
Socrates
himself
would
not
be
member
of
his
ideal
state
His
life
was
almost
solely
dedicated
to
private
pursuit
of
knowledge
More
practically
Socrates
suggests
that
members
of
lower
classes
could
rise
to
higher
ruling
class
and
vice
versa
if
they
had
gold
in
their
veins
version
of
concept
of
social
mobility
The
exercise
of
power
is
built
on
noble
lie
that
all
men
are
brothers
born
of
earth
yet
there
is
clear
hierarchy
and
class
divisions
There
is
tripartite
explanation
of
human
psychology
that
is
extrapolated
to
city
relation
among
peoples
There
is
no
family
among
guardians
another
crude
version
of
Max
Webers
concept
of
bureaucracy
as
state
nonprivate
concern
Together
with
Leo
Strauss
Voegelin
considered
Poppers
interpretation
to
be
gross
misunderstanding
not
only
of
dialogue
itself
but
of
very
nature
and
character
of
Platos
entire
philosophic
enterprise
Strauss
and
Bloomedit
Some
of
Platos
proposals
have
led
theorists
like
Leo
Strauss
and
Allan
Bloom
to
ask
readers
to
consider
possibility
that
Socrates
was
creating
not
blueprint
for
real
city
but
learning
exercise
for
young
men
in
dialogue
There
are
many
points
in
construction
of
Just
City
in
Speech
that
seem
contradictory
which
raise
possibility
Socrates
is
employing
irony
to
make
men
in
dialogue
question
for
themselves
ultimate
value
of
proposals
In
turn
Plato
has
immortalized
this
learning
exercise
in
Republic
One
of
many
examples
is
that
Socrates
calls
marriages
of
ruling
class
sacred
however
they
last
only
one
night
and
are
result
of
manipulating
and
drugging
couples
into
predetermined
intercourse
with
aim
of
eugenically
breeding
guardianwarriors
Strauss
and
Blooms
interpretations
however
involve
more
than
just
pointing
out
inconsistencies
by
calling
attention
to
these
issues
they
ask
readers
to
think
more
deeply
about
whether
Plato
is
being
ironic
or
genuine
for
neither
Strauss
nor
Bloom
present
unequivocal
opinion
preferring
to
raise
philosophic
doubt
over
interpretive
fact
Strausss
approach
developed
out
of
belief
that
Plato
wrote
esoterically
The
basic
acceptance
of
exotericesoteric
distinction
revolves
around
whether
Plato
really
wanted
to
see
Just
City
in
Speech
of
Books
VVI
come
to
pass
or
whether
it
is
just
allegory
Strauss
never
regarded
this
as
crucial
issue
of
dialogue
He
argued
against
Karl
Poppers
literal
view
citing
Ciceros
opinion
that
Republics
true
nature
was
to
bring
to
light
nature
of
political
things
In
fact
Strauss
undermines
justice
found
in
Just
City
in
Speech
by
implying
city
is
not
natural
it
is
manmade
conceit
that
abstracts
away
from
erotic
needs
of
body
The
city
founded
in
Republic
is
rendered
possible
by
abstraction
from
eros
An
argument
that
has
been
used
against
ascribing
ironic
intent
to
Plato
is
that
Platos
Academy
produced
number
of
tyrants
who
seized
political
power
and
abandoned
philosophy
for
ruling
city
Despite
being
wellversed
in
Greek
and
having
direct
contact
with
Plato
himself
some
of
Platos
former
students
like
Clearchus
tyrant
of
Heraclea
Chaeron
tyrant
of
Pellene
Erastus
and
Coriscus
tyrants
of
Skepsis
Hermias
of
Atarneus
and
Assos
and
Calippus
tyrant
of
Syracuse
ruled
people
and
did
not
impose
anything
like
philosopherkingship
However
it
can
be
argued
whether
these
men
became
tyrants
through
studying
in
Academy
Platos
school
had
elite
student
body
some
of
whom
would
by
birth
and
family
expectation
end
up
in
seats
of
power
Additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
that
these
men
were
tyrants
in
modern
totalitarian
sense
of
concept
Finally
since
very
little
is
actually
known
about
what
was
taught
at
Platos
Academy
there
is
no
small
controversy
over
whether
it
was
even
in
business
of
teaching
politics
at
all
Views
on
citysoul
analogyedit
Many
critics
both
ancient
and
modern
like
Julia
Annas
have
suggested
that
dialogues
political
discussion
actually
serves
as
analogy
for
individual
soul
in
which
there
are
also
many
different
members
that
can
either
conflict
or
else
be
integrated
and
orchestrated
under
just
and
productive
government
Among
other
things
this
analogical
reading
would
solve
problem
of
certain
implausible
statements
Plato
makes
concerning
ideal
political
republic
Norbert
Blssner
argues
that
Republic
is
best
understood
as
analysis
of
workings
and
moral
improvement
of
individual
soul
with
remarkable
thoroughness
and
clarity
This
view
of
course
does
not
preclude
legitimate
reading
of
Republic
as
political
treatise
work
could
operate
at
both
levels
It
merely
implies
that
it
deserves
more
attention
as
work
on
psychology
and
moral
philosophy
than
it
has
sometimes
received
Practicalityedit
The
abovementioned
views
have
in
common
that
they
view
Republic
as
theoretical
work
not
as
set
of
guidelines
for
good
governance
However
Popper
insists
that
Republic
was
meant
by
its
author
not
so
much
as
theoretical
treatise
but
as
topical
political
manifesto
and
Bertrand
Russell
argues
that
at
least
in
intent
and
all
in
all
not
so
far
from
what
was
possible
in
ancient
Greek
citystates
form
of
government
portrayed
in
Republic
was
meant
as
practical
one
by
Plato
st
centuryedit
One
of
Platos
recurring
techniques
in
Republic
is
to
refine
concept
of
justice
with
reference
to
various
examples
of
greater
or
lesser
injustice
However
in
The
Concept
of
Injustice
Eric
Heinze
challenges
assumption
that
justice
and
injustice
form
mutually
exclusive
pair
Heinze
argues
that
such
assumption
traces
not
from
strict
deductive
logic
but
from
arbitrary
etymology
of
word
injustice
Heinze
critiques
what
he
calls
classical
Western
justice
theory
for
having
perpetuated
that
logical
error
which
first
appears
in
Platos
Republic
but
manifests
throughout
traditional
political
philosophy
in
thinkers
otherwise
as
different
as
Aristotle
Aquinas
Locke
Rousseau
Hegel
and
Marx
In
survey
of
over
academics
and
students

Republic

philosophical
text

Julian
Baggini
argued
that
although
work
was
wrong
on
almost
every
point
questions
it
raises
and
methods
it
uses
are
essential
to
western
tradition
of
philosophy
Without
it
we
might
not
have
philosophy
as
we
know
it

Place

Platos
corpusedit
The
Republic
is
generally
placed
in
middle
period
of
Platos
dialoguesthat
is
it
is
believed
to
be
written
after
early
period
dialogues
but
before
late
period
dialogues
However
distinction
of
this
group
from
early
dialogues
is
not
as
clear
as
distinction
of
late
dialogues
from
all
others
Nonetheless
Ritter
Arnim
and
Baronwith
their
separate
methodologiesall
agreed
that
Republic
was
well
distinguished
along
with
Parmenides
Phaedrus
and
Theaetetus
However
first
book
of
Republic
which
shares
many
features
with
earlier
dialogues
is
thought
to
have
originally
been
written
as
separate
work
and
then
remaining
books
were
conjoined
to
it
perhaps
with
modifications
to
original
of
first
book
Fragmentsedit

Oxyrhynchus

Fragments
of
different

Book
Iedit
In
first
book
Aristotle
discusses
city
polis
or
political
community
koinnia
politik
as
opposed
to
other
types
of
communities
and
partnerships
such
as
household
oikos
and
village
The
highest
form
of
community
is
polis
Aristotle
comes
to
this
conclusion
because
he
believes
public
life
is
far
more
virtuous
than
private
and
because
men
are
political
animals
He
begins
with
relationship
between
city
and
man
I
and
then
specifically
discusses
household
oikos
I
He
takes
issue
with
view
that
political
rule
kingly
rule
rule
over
slaves
and
rule
over
household
or
village
are
only
different
in
size
He
then
examines
in
what
way
city
may
be
said
to
be
natural
Aristotle
discusses
parts
of
household
oikos
which
includes
slaves
leading
to
discussion
of
whether
slavery
can
ever
be
just
and
better
for
person
enslaved
or
is
always
unjust
and
bad
He
distinguishes
between
those
who
are
slaves
because
law
says
they
are
and
those
who
are
slaves
by
nature
saying
inquiry
hinges
on
whether
there
are
any
such
natural
slaves
Only
someone
as
different
from
other
people
as
body
is
from
soul
or
beasts
are
from
human
beings
would
be
slave
by
nature
Aristotle
concludes
all
others
being
slaves
solely
by
law
or
convention
Some
scholars
have
therefore
concluded
that
qualifications
for
natural
slavery
preclude
existence
of
such
being
Aristotle
then
moves
to
question
of
property
in
general
arguing
that
acquisition
of
property
does
not
form
part
of
household
management
oikonomike
and
criticizing
those
who
take
it
too
seriously
It
is
necessary
but
that
does
not
make
it
part
of
household
management
any
more
than
it
makes
medicine
part
of
household
management
just
because
health
is
necessary
He
criticizes
income
based
upon
trade
and
upon
interest
saying
that
those
who
become
avaricious
do
so
because
they
forget
that
money
merely
symbolizes
wealth
without
being
wealth
and
contrary
to
nature
on
interest
because
it
increases
by
itself
not
through
exchange
Book
I
concludes
with
Aristotles
assertion
that
proper
object
of
household
rule
is
virtuous
character
of
ones
wife
and
children
not
management
of
slaves
or
acquisition
of
property
Rule
over
slaves
is
despotic
rule
over
children
kingly
and
rule
over
ones
wife
political
except
there
is
no
rotation
in
office
Aristotle
questions
whether
it
is
sensible
to
speak
of
virtue
of
slave
and
whether
virtues
of
wife
and
children
are
same
as
those
of
man
before
saying
that
because
city
must
be
concerned
that
its
women
and
children
be
virtuous
virtues
that
father
should
instill
are
dependent
upon
regime
and
so
discussion
must
turn
to
what
has
been
said
about
best
regime
Book
IIedit
Book
II
examines
various
views
concerning
best
regime
It
opens
with
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
Platos
Republic
holding
that
communal
share
of
property
between
guardians
will
increase
rather
than
decrease
dissensions
and
sharing
of
wives
and
children
will
destroy
natural
affection
He
concludes
that
common
sense
is
against
this
arrangement
for
good
reason
and
claims
that
experiment
shows
it
to
be
impractical
Next
analysis
of
regime
presented
in
Platos
Laws
Aristotle
then
discusses
systems
presented
by
two
other
philosophers
Phaleas
of
Chalcedon
and
Hippodamus
of
Miletus
After
addressing
regimes
invented
by
theorists
Aristotle
moves
to
examination
of
three
regimes
that
are
commonly
held
to
be
well
managed
These
are
Spartan
Cretan
and
Carthaginian
The
book
concludes
with
some
observations
on
regimes
and
legislators
Book
IIIedit
Who
can
be
citizen
He
who
has
power
to
take
part
in
deliberative
or
judicial
administration
of
any
state
is
said
by
us
to
be
citizen
of
that
state
and
speaking
generally
state
is
body
of
citizens
sufficing
for
purpose
of
life
But
in
practice
citizen
is
defined
to
be
one
of
whom
both
parents
are
citizens
others
insist
on
going
further
back
say
two
or
three
or
more
grandparents
Aristotle
asserts
that
citizen
is
anyone
who
can
take
part
in
governmental
process
He
finds
that
most
people
in
polis
are
capable
of
being
citizens
This
is
contrary
to
Platonist
view
asserting
that
only
very
few
can
take
part
in
deliberative
or
judicial
administration
of
state

Classification
of
constitutionsedit
After
studying
number
of
real
and
theoretical
citystates
constitutions
Aristotle
classified
them
according
to
various
criteria
On
one
side
stand
true
or
good
constitutions
which
are
considered
such
because
they
aim
for
common
good
and
on
other
side
perverted
or
deviant
ones
considered
such
because
they
aim
for
well
being
of
only
part
of
city
The
constitutions
are
then
sorted
according
to
number
of
those
who
participate
to
magistracies
one
few
or
many
Aristotles
sixfold
classification
is
slightly
different
from
one
found
in
The
Statesman
by
Plato
The
diagram
above
illustrates
Aristotles
classification
Moreover
following
Platos
vague
ideas
he
developed
coherent
theory
of
integrating
various
forms
of
power
into
socalled
mixed
state
It
is
constitutional
to
take
from
oligarchy
that
offices
are
to
be
elected
and
from
democracy
that
this
is
not
to
be
on
propertyqualification
This
then
is
mode
of
mixture
and
mark
of
good
mixture
of
democracy
and
oligarchy
is
when
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
same
constitution
as
democracy
and
as
oligarchy
Aristotle
Politics
Book
b
To
illustrate
this
approach
Aristotle
proposed
firstofitskind
mathematical
model
of
voting

textually
described
where

one

vote
is
combined
with
oligarchic

Tangian
Compositionedit
The
literary
character
of
Politics
is
subject
to
some
dispute
growing
out
of
textual
difficulties
that
attended
loss
of
Aristotles
works
Book
III
ends
with
sentence
that
is
repeated
almost
verbatim
at
start
of
Book
VII
while
intervening
Books
IVVI
seem
to
have
different
flavor
from
rest
Book
IV
seems
to
refer
several
times
back
to
discussion
of
best
regime
contained
in
Books
VIIVIII
Some
editors
have
therefore
inserted
Books
VIIVIII
after
Book
III
At
same
time
however
references
to
discourses
on
politics
that
occur
in
Nicomachean
Ethics
suggest
that
treatise
as
whole
ought
to
conclude
with
discussion
of
education
that
occurs
in
Book
VIII
of
Politics
although
it
is
not
certain
that
Aristotle
is
referring
to
Politics
here
Werner
Jaeger
suggested
that
Politics
actually
represents
conflation
of
two
distinct
treatises
The
first
Books
IIII
VIIVIII
would
represent
less
mature
work
from
when
Aristotle
had
not
yet
fully
broken
from
Plato
and
consequently
show
greater
emphasis
on
best
regime
The
second
Books
IVVI
would
be
more
empirically
minded
and
thus
belong
to
later
stage
of
development
Carnes
Lord
scholar
on
Aristotle
has
argued
against
sufficiency
of
this
view
however
noting
numerous
crossreferences
between
Jaegers
supposedly
separate
works
and
questioning
difference
in
tone
that
Jaeger
saw
between
them
For
example
Book
IV
explicitly
notes
utility
of
examining
actual
regimes
Jaegers
empirical
focus
in
determining
best
regime
Jaegers
Platonic
focus
Instead
Lord
suggests
that
Politics
is
indeed
finished
treatise
and
that
Books
VII
and
VIII
do
belong
in
between
Books
III
and
IV
he
attributes
their
current
ordering
to
merely
mechanical
transcription
error
It
is
uncertain
if
Politics
was
translated
into
Arabic
like
most
of
his
major
works
Its
influence
and
ideas
were
however
carried
over
to
Arabic
philosophers

Politics
from
Greek
politik
affairs
of
cities
is
set
of
activities
that
are
associated
with
making
decisions
in
groups
or
other
forms
of
power
relations
between
individuals
such
as
distribution
of
resources
or
status
The
branch
of
social
science
that
studies
politics
is
referred
to
as
political
science
It
may
be
used
positively
in
context
of
political
solution
which
is
compromising
and
nonviolent
or
descriptively
as
art
or
science
of
government
but
also
often
carries
negative
connotation
For
example
abolitionist
Wendell
Phillips
declared
that
we
do
not
play
politics
antislavery
is
no
halfjest
with
us
The
concept
has
been
defined
in
various
ways
and
different
approaches
have
fundamentally
differing
views
on
whether
it
should
be
used
extensively
or
limitedly
empirically
or
normatively
and
on
whether
conflict
or
cooperation
is
more
essential
to
it
A
variety
of
methods
are
deployed
in
politics
which
include
promoting
ones
own
political
views
among
people
negotiation
with
other
political
subjects
making
laws
and
exercising
force
including
warfare
against
adversaries
Politics
is
exercised
on
wide
range
of
social
levels
from
clans
and
tribes
of
traditional
societies
through
modern
local
governments
companies
and
institutions
up
to
sovereign
states
to
international
level
In
modern
nation
states
people
often
form
political
parties
to
represent
their
ideas
Members
of
party
often
agree
to
take
same
position
on
many
issues
and
agree
to
support
same
changes
to
law
and
same
leaders
An
election
is
usually
competition
between
different
parties
A
political
system
is
framework
which
defines
acceptable
political
methods
within
society
The
history
of
political
thought
can
be
traced
back
to
early
antiquity
with
seminal
works
such
as
Platos
Republic
Aristotles
Politics
Chanakyas
Arthashastra
and
Chanakya
Niti
rd
century
BCE
as
well
as
works
of
Confucius

Etymologyedit
The
English
politics
has
its
roots
in
name
of
Aristotles
classic
work
Politik
which
introduced
Greek
term
politik
affairs
of
cities
In
midth
century
Aristotles
composition
would
be
rendered
in
Early
Modern
English
as
Polettiques
sic
which
would
become
Politics
in
Modern
English
The
singular
politic
first
attested
in
English
in
coming
from
Middle
French
politiqueitself
taking
from
politicus
Latinization
of
Greek
politikos
from
polites
citizen
and
polis
city
Definitionsedit
In
view
of
Harold
Lasswell
politics
is
who
gets
what
when
how
For
David
Easton
it
is
about
authoritative
allocation
of
values
for
society
To
Vladimir
Lenin
politics
is
most
concentrated
expression
of
economics
Bernard
Crick
argued
that
politics
is
distinctive
form
of
rule
whereby
people
act
together
through
institutionalized
procedures
to
resolve
differences
to
conciliate
diverse
interests
and
values
and
to
make
public
policies
in
pursuit
of
common
purposes
According
to
Adrian
Leftwich
Politics
comprises
all
activities
of
cooperation
negotiation
and
conflict
within
and
between
societies
whereby
people
go
about
organizing
use
production
or
distribution
of
human
natural
and
other
resources
in
course
of
production
and
reproduction
of
their
biological
and
social
life
Approachesedit
There
are
several
ways
in
which
approaching
politics
has
been
conceptualized
Extensive
and
limitededit
Adrian
Leftwich
has
differentiated
views
of
politics
based
on
how
extensive
or
limited
their
perception
of
what
accounts
as
political
is
The
extensive
view
sees
politics
as
present
across
sphere
of
human
social
relations
while
limited
view
restricts
it
to
certain
contexts
For
example
in
more
restrictive
way
politics
may
be
viewed
as
primarily
about
governance
while
feminist
perspective
could
argue
that
sites
which
have
been
viewed
traditionally
as
nonpolitical
should
indeed
be
viewed
as
political
as
well
This
latter
position
is
encapsulated
in
slogan
personal
is
political
which
disputes
distinction
between
private
and
public
issues
Instead
politics
may
be
defined
by
use
of
power
as
has
been
argued
by
Robert
A
Dahl
Moralism
and
realismedit
Some
perspectives
on
politics
view
it
empirically
as
exercise
of
power
while
others
see
it
as
social
function
with
normative
basis
This
distinction
has
been
called
difference
between
political
moralism
and
political
realism
For
moralists
politics
is
closely
linked
to
ethics
and
is
at
its
extreme
in
utopian
thinking
For
example
according
to
Hannah
Arendt
view
of
Aristotle
was
that
to
be
politicalmeant
that
everything
was
decided
through
words
and
persuasion
and
not
through
violence
while
according
to
Bernard
Crick
politics
is
way
in
which
free
societies
are
governed
Politics
is
politics
and
other
forms
of
rule
are
something
else
In
contrast
for
realists
represented
by
those
such
as
Niccol
Machiavelli
Thomas
Hobbes
and
Harold
Lasswell
politics
is
based
on
use
of
power
irrespective
of
ends
being
pursued
Conflict
and
cooperationedit
Agonism
argues
that
politics
essentially
comes
down
to
conflict
between
conflicting
interests
Political
scientist
Elmer
Schattschneider
argued
that
at
root
of
all
politics
is
universal
language
of
conflict
while
for
Carl
Schmitt
essence
of
politics
is
distinction
of
friend
from
foe
This
is
in
direct
contrast
to
more
cooperative
views
of
politics
by
Aristotle
and
Crick
However
more
mixed
view
between
these
extremes
is
provided
by
Irish
political
scientist
Michael
Laver
who
noted
that
Politics
is
about
characteristic
blend
of
conflict
and
cooperation
that
can
be
found
so
often
in
human
interactions
Pure
conflict
is
war
Pure
cooperation
is
true
love
Politics
is
mixture
of
both

history
of

to

Prehistoricedit
Frans
de

that
already

and

positions
Early

These

referred

as

Early
statesedit
In
ancient
history
civilizations
did
not
have
definite
boundaries
as
states
have
today
and
their
borders
could
be
more
accurately
described
as
frontiers
Early
dynastic
Sumer
and
early
dynastic
Egypt
were
first
civilizations
to
define
their
borders
Moreover
up
to
th
century
many
people
lived
in
nonstate
societies
These
range
from
relatively
egalitarian
bands
and
tribes
to
complex
and
highly
stratified
chiefdoms
State
formationedit
Main
article
State
formation
There
are
number
of
different
theories
and
hypotheses
regarding
early
state
formation
that
seek
generalizations
to
explain
why
state
developed
in
some
places
but
not
others
Other
scholars
believe
that
generalizations
are
unhelpful
and
that
each
case
of
early
state
formation
should
be
treated
on
its
own
Voluntary
theories
contend
that
diverse
groups
of
people
came
together
to
form
states
as
result
of
some
shared
rational
interest
The
theories
largely
focus
on
development
of
agriculture
and
population
and
organizational
pressure
that
followed
and
resulted
in
state
formation
One
of
most
prominent
theories
of
early
and
primary
state
formation
is
hydraulic
hypothesis
which
contends
that
state
was
result
of
need
to
build
and
maintain
largescale
irrigation
projects
Conflict
theories
of
state
formation
regard
conflict
and
dominance
of
some
population
over
another
population
as
key
to
formation
of
states
In
contrast
with
voluntary
theories
these
arguments
believe
that
people
do
not
voluntarily
agree
to
create
state
to
maximize
benefits
but
that
states
form
due
to
some
form
of
oppression
by
one
group
over
others
Some
theories
in
turn
argue
that
warfare
was
critical
for
state
formation
Ancient
historyedit
The
first
states
of
sorts
were
those
of
early
dynastic
Sumer
and
early
dynastic
Egypt
which
arose
from
Uruk
period
and
Predynastic
Egypt
respectively
around
approximately
BCE
Early
dynastic
Egypt
was
based
around
Nile
River
in
northeast
of
Africa
kingdoms
boundaries
being
based
around
Nile
and
stretching
to
areas
where
oases
existed
Early
dynastic
Sumer
was
located
in
southern
Mesopotamia
with
its
borders
extending
from
Persian
Gulf
to
parts
of
Euphrates
and
Tigris
rivers
Although
stateforms
existed
before
rise
of
Ancient
Greek
empire
Greeks
were
first
people
known
to
have
explicitly
formulated
political
philosophy
of
state
and
to
have
rationally
analyzed
political
institutions
Prior
to
this
states
were
described
and
justified
in
terms
of
religious
myths
Several
important
political
innovations
of
classical
antiquity
came
from
Greek
citystates
polis
and
Roman
Republic
The
Greek
citystates
before
th
century
granted
citizenship
rights
to
their
free
population
in
Athens
these
rights
were
combined
with
directly
democratic
form
of
government
that
was
to
have
long
afterlife

political

The
Peace
of
Westphalia
is
considered
by
political
scientists
to
be
beginning
of
modern
international
system
in
which
external
powers
should
avoid
interfering
in
another
countrys
domestic
affairs
The
principle
of
noninterference
in
other
countries
domestic
affairs
was
laid
out
in
midth
century
by
Swiss
jurist
Emer
de
Vattel
States
became
primary
institutional
agents
in
interstate
system
of
relations
The
Peace
of
Westphalia
is
said
to
have
ended
attempts
to
impose
supranational
authority
on
European
states
The
Westphalian
doctrine
of
states
as
independent
agents
was
bolstered
by
rise
in
th
century
thought
of
nationalism
under
which
legitimate
states
were
assumed
to
correspond
to
nationsgroups
of
people
united
by
language
and
culture
In
Europe
during
th
century
classic
nonnational
states
were
multinational
empires
Austrian
Empire
Kingdom
of
France
Kingdom
of
Hungary
Russian
Empire
Spanish
Empire
Ottoman
Empire
and
British
Empire
Such
empires
also
existed
in
Asia
Africa
and
Americas
in
Muslim
world
immediately
after
death
of
Muhammad
in
Caliphates
were
established
which
developed
into
multiethnic
transnational
empires
The
multinational
empire
was
absolute
monarchy
ruled
by
king
emperor
or
sultan
The
population
belonged
to
many
ethnic
groups
and
they
spoke
many
languages
The
empire
was
dominated
by
one
ethnic
group
and
their
language
was
usually
language
of
public
administration
The
ruling
dynasty
was
usually
but
not
always
from
that
group
Some
of
smaller
European
states
were
not
so
ethnically
diverse
but
were
also
dynastic
states
ruled
by
royal
house
A
few
of
smaller
states
survived
such
as
independent
principalities
of
Liechtenstein
Andorra
Monaco
and
republic
of
San
Marino
Most
theories
see
nation
state
as
thcentury
European
phenomenon
facilitated
by
developments
such
as
statemandated
education
mass
literacy
and
mass
media
However
historianswho
also
note
early
emergence
of
relatively
unified
state
and
identity
in
Portugal
and
Dutch
Republic
Scholars
such
as
Steven
Weber
David
Woodward
Michel
Foucault
and
Jeremy
Black
have
advanced
hypothesis
that
nation
state
did
not
arise
out
of
political
ingenuity
or

Systems
view
of
politics
The
political
system
defines
process
for
making
official
government
decisions
It
is
usually
compared
to
legal
system
economic
system
cultural
system
and
other
social
systems
According
to
David
Easton
A
political
system
can
be
designated
as
interactions
through
which
values
are
authoritatively
allocated
for
society
Each
political
system
is
embedded
in
society
with
its
own
political
culture
and
they
in
turn
shape
their
societies
through
public
policy
The
interactions
between
different
political
systems
are
basis
for
global
politics
Forms

Legislatures
are
important
political
institution
Pictured

Forms
of
government
can
be
classified
by
several
ways
In
terms
of
structure
of
power
there
are
monarchies
including
constitutional
monarchies
and
republics
usually
presidential
semipresidential
or

The

degree
of
horizontal

other
independent
institutions

The

determines
difference
between
democracies
oligarchies
and
autocracies
In
democracy
political
legitimacy
is
based
on
popular
sovereignty
Forms
of
democracy
include
representative
democracy
direct
democracy
and
demarchy
These
are
separated
by
way
decisions
are
made
whether
by
elected
representatives
referendums
or
by
citizen

Democracies
can
be
either
republics
or

monarchies
Oligarchy
is
power

geniocracy
gerontocracy
kakistocracy
kleptocracy

Vertical
integrationedit
In
terms
of
level
of
vertical
integration
political
systems
can
be
divided
into
from
least
to
most
integrated
confederations
federations
and
unitary
states
A
federation
also
known
as
federal
state
is
political
entity
characterized
by
union
of
partially
selfgoverning
provinces
states
or
other
regions
under
central
federal
government
federalism
In
federation
selfgoverning
status
of
component
states
as
well
as
division
of
power
between
them
and
central
government
is
typically
constitutionally
entrenched
and
may
not
be
altered
by
unilateral
decision
of
either
party
states
or
federal
political
body
Federations
were
formed
first
in
Switzerland
then
in
United

in
in

All
above
forms
of
government
are
variations
of

basic
polity
sovereign
state
The
state
has
been
defined
by
Max
Weber
as
political
entity
that
has
monopoly
on
violence
within
its
territory
while
Montevideo
Convention
holds
that
states
need
to
have
defined
territory
permanent
population
government
and
capacity
to
enter
into
international

A
stateless
society
is
society
that
is
not
governed
by
state
In
stateless
societies
there
is
little
concentration
of
authority
most
positions
of
authority
that
do
exist
are
very
limited
in
power
and
are
generally
not
permanently
held
positions
and
social
bodies
that
resolve
disputes
through
predefined
rules
tend
to
be
small
Stateless
societies
are
highly
variable
in
economic
organization
and
cultural
practices
While
stateless
societies
were
norm
in
human
prehistory
few
stateless
societies
exist
today
almost
entire
global
population
resides
within
jurisdiction
of
sovereign
state
In
some
regions
nominal
state
authorities
may
be
very
weak
and
wield
little
or
no
actual
power
Over
course
of
history
most
stateless
peoples
have
been
integrated
into
statebased
societies
around
them
Some
political
philosophies
consider
state
undesirable
and
thus
consider
formation
of
stateless
society
goal
to
be
achieved
A
central
tenet
of
anarchism
is
advocacy
of
society
without
states
The
type
of
society
sought
for
varies
significantly
between
anarchist
schools
of
thought
ranging
from
extreme
individualism
to
complete
collectivism
In
Marxism
Marxs
theory
of
state
considers
that
in
postcapitalist
society
state
undesirable
institution
would
be
unnecessary
and
wither
away
A
related
concept
is
that
of
stateless
communism
phrase
sometimes
used
to
describe
Marxs
anticipated
postcapitalist
society
Constitutionsedit
Constitutions
are
written
documents
that
specify
and
limit
powers
of
different
branches
of
government
Although
constitution
is
written
document
there
is
also
unwritten
constitution
The
unwritten
constitution
is
continually
being
written
by
legislative
and
judiciary
branch
of
government
this
is
just
one
of
those
cases
in
which
nature
of
circumstances
determines
form
of
government
that
is
most
appropriate
England
did
set
fashion
of
written
constitutions
during
Civil
War
but
after
Restoration
abandoned
them
to
be
taken
up
later
by
American
Colonies
after
their
emancipation
and
then
France
after
Revolution
and
rest
of
Europe
including
European

Constitutions
often
set
out
separation
of

dividing
government
into
executive
legislature
and

together
referred

as
trias

Democracy
Democracy
is
system
of
processing
conflicts
in
which
outcomes
depend
on
what
participants
do
but
no
single
force
controls
what
occurs
and
its
outcomes
The
uncertainty
of
outcomes
is
inherent
in
democracy
Democracy
makes
all
forces
struggle
repeatedly
to
realize
their
interests
and
devolves
power
from
groups
of
people
to
sets
of
rules
Among
modern
political
theorists
there
are
three
contending
conceptions
of
democracy
aggregative
deliberative
and
radical
Aggregativeedit
The
theory
of
aggregative
democracy
claims
that
aim
of
democratic
processes
is
to
solicit
preferences
of
citizens
and
aggregate
them
together
to
determine
what
social
policies
society
should
adopt
Therefore
proponents
of
this
view
hold
that
democratic
participation
should
primarily
focus
on
voting
where
policy
with
most
votes
gets
implemented
Different
variants
of
aggregative
democracy
exist
Under
minimalism
democracy
is
system
of
government
in
which
citizens
have
given
teams
of
political
leaders
right
to
rule
in
periodic
elections
According
to
this
minimalist
conception
citizens
cannot
and
should
not
rule
because
for
example
on
most
issues
most
of
time
they
have
no
clear
views
or
their
views
are
not
wellfounded
Joseph
Schumpeter
articulated
this
view
most
famously
in
his
book
Capitalism
Socialism
and
Democracy
Contemporary
proponents
of
minimalism
include
William
H
Riker
Adam
Przeworski
Richard
Posner
According
to
theory
of
direct
democracy
on
other
hand
citizens
should
vote
directly
not
through
their
representatives
on
legislative
proposals
Proponents
of
direct
democracy
offer
varied
reasons
to
support
this
view
Political
activity
can
be
valuable
in
itself
it
socializes
and
educates
citizens
and
popular
participation
can
check
powerful
elites
Most
importantly
citizens
do
not
rule
themselves
unless
they
directly
decide
laws
and
policies
Governments
will
tend
to
produce
laws
and
policies
that
are
close
to
views
of
median
voterwith
half
to
their
left
and
other
half
to
their
right
This
is
not
desirable
outcome
as
it
represents
action
of
selfinterested
and
somewhat
unaccountable
political
elites
competing
for
votes
Anthony
Downs
suggests
that
ideological
political
parties
are
necessary
to
act
as
mediating
broker
between
individual
and
governments
Downs
laid
out
this
view
in
his
book
An
Economic
Theory
of
Democracy
Robert
A
Dahl
argues
that
fundamental
democratic
principle
is
that
when
it
comes
to
binding
collective
decisions
each
person
in
political
community
is
entitled
to
have
hisher
interests
be
given
equal
consideration
not
necessarily
that
all
people
are
equally
satisfied
by
collective
decision
He
uses
term
polyarchy
to
refer
to
societies
in
which
there
exists
certain
set
of
institutions
and
procedures
which
are
perceived
as
leading
to
such
democracy
First
and
foremost
among
these
institutions
is
regular
occurrence
of
free
and
open
elections
which
are
used
to
select
representatives
who
then
manage
all
or
most
of
public
policy
of
society
However
these
polyarchic
procedures
may
not
create
full
democracy
if
for
example
poverty
prevents
political
participation
Similarly
Ronald
Dworkin
argues
that
democracy
is
substantive
not
merely
procedural
ideal
Deliberativeedit
Main
article
Deliberative
democracy
Deliberative
democracy
is
based
on
notion
that
democracy
is
government
by
deliberation
Unlike
aggregative
democracy
deliberative
democracy
holds
that
for
democratic
decision
to
be
legitimate
it
must
be
preceded
by
authentic
deliberation
not
merely
aggregation
of
preferences
that
occurs
in
voting
Authentic
deliberation
is
deliberation
among
decisionmakers
that
is
free
from
distortions
of
unequal
political
power
such
as
power
decisionmaker
obtained
through
economic
wealth
or
support
of
interest
groups
If
decisionmakers
cannot
reach
consensus
after
authentically
deliberating
on
proposal
then
they
vote
on
proposal
using
form
of
majority
rule

Social
equality
Equality
is
state
of
affairs
in
which
all
people
within
specific
society
or
isolated
group
have
same
social
status
especially
socioeconomic
status
including
protection
of
human
rights
and
dignity
and
equal
access
to
certain
social
goods
and
social
services
Furthermore
it
may
also
include
health
equality
economic
equality
and
other
social
securities
Social
equality
requires
absence
of
legally
enforced
social
class
or
caste
boundaries
and
absence
of
discrimination
motivated
by
inalienable
part
of
persons
identity
To
this
end
there
must
be
equal
justice
under
law
and
equal
opportunity
regardless
of
for
example
sex
gender
ethnicity
age
sexual
orientation
origin
caste
or
class
income
or
property
language
religion
convictions
opinions
health

disability
Leftright
spectrumedit
A
common
way
of
understanding
politics
is
through
leftright
political
spectrum
which
ranges
from
leftwing
politics
via
centrism
to
rightwing
politics
This
classification
is
comparatively
recent
and
dates
from
French
Revolution
when
those
members
of
National
Assembly
who
supported
republic
common
people
and
secular
society
sat
on
left
and
supporters
of
monarchy
aristocratic
privilege
and
Church
sat
on
right
Today
left
is
generally
progressivist
seeking
social
progress
in
society
The
more
extreme
elements
of
left
named
farleft
tend
to
support
revolutionary
means
for
achieving
this
This
includes
ideologies
such
as
Communism
and
Marxism
The
centerleft
on
other
hand
advocate
for
more
reformist
approaches
for
example
that
of
social
democracy
In
contrast
right
is
generally
motivated
by
conservatism
which
seeks
to
conserve
what
it
sees
as
important
elements
of
society
The
farright
goes
beyond
this
and
often
represents
reactionary
turn
against
progress
seeking
to
undo
it
Examples
of
such
ideologies
have
included
Fascism
and
Nazism
The
centerright
may
be
less
clearcut
and
more
mixed
in
this
regard
with
neoconservatives
supporting
spread
of
democracy
and
onenation
conservatives
more
open
to
social
welfare
programs
According
to
Norberto
Bobbio
one
of
major
exponents
of
this
distinction
left
believes
in
attempting
to
eradicate
social
inequalitybelieving
it
to
be
unethical
or
unnatural
while
right
regards
most
social
inequality
as
result
of
ineradicable
natural
inequalities
and
sees
attempts
to
enforce
social
equality
as
utopian
or
authoritarian
Some
ideologies
notably
Christian
Democracy
claim
to
combine
left
and
rightwing
politics
according
to
Geoffrey
K
Roberts
and
Patricia
Hogwood
In
terms
of
ideology
Christian
Democracy
has
incorporated
many
of
views
held
by
liberals
conservatives
and
socialists
within
wider
framework
of
moral
and
Christian
principles
Movements
which
claim
or
formerly
claimed
to
be
above

include

Political
freedom
Political
freedom
also
known
as
political
liberty
or
autonomy
is
central
concept
in
political
thought
and
one
of
most
important
features
of
democratic
societies
Negative
liberty
has
been
described
as
freedom
from
oppression
or
coercion
and
unreasonable
external
constraints
on
action
often
enacted
through
civil
and
political
rights
while
positive
liberty
is
absence
of
disabling
conditions
for
individual
and
fulfillment
of
enabling
conditions
eg
economic
compulsion
in
society
This
capability
approach
to
freedom
requires
economic
social
and
cultural
rights
in
order
to
be
realized
Authoritarianism
and
libertarianismedit
Authoritarianism
and
libertarianism
disagree
amount
of
individual
freedom
each
person
possesses
in
that
society
relative
to
state
One
author
describes
authoritarian
political
systems
as
those
where
individual
rights
and
goals
are
subjugated
to
group
goals
expectations
and
conformities
while
libertarians
generally
oppose
state
and
hold
individual
as
sovereign
In
their
purest
form
libertarians
are
anarchists
who
argue
for
total
abolition
of
state
of
political
parties
and
of
other
political
entities
while
purest
authoritarians
are
by
definition
totalitarians
who
support
state
control
over
all
aspects
of
society
For
instance
classical
liberalism
also
known
as
laissezfaire
liberalism
is
doctrine
stressing
individual
freedom
and
limited
government
This
includes
importance
of
human
rationality
individual
property
rights
free
markets
natural
rights
protection
of
civil
liberties
constitutional
limitation
of
government
and
individual
freedom
from
restraint
as
exemplified
in
writings
of
John
Locke
Adam
Smith
David
Hume
David
Ricardo
Voltaire
Montesquieu
and
others
According
to
libertarian
Institute
for
Humane
Studies
libertarian
or
classical
liberal
perspective
is
that
individual
wellbeing
prosperity
and
social
harmony
are
fostered
by
as
much
liberty
as
possible
and
as
little
government
as
necessary
For
anarchist
political
philosopher
L
Susan
Brown
liberalism
and
anarchism
are
two
political
philosophies
that
are
fundamentally
concerned
with
individual
freedom
yet
differ
from
one
another
in
very
distinct
ways
Anarchism
shares
with
liberalism
radical
commitment
to
individual
freedom
while
rejecting
liberalisms
competitive
property
relations

Political
economy
is
study
of
production
and
trade
and
their
relations
with
law
custom
and
government
and
with
distribution
of
national
income
and
wealth
As

political
economy
originated
in
moral
philosophy
in
th
century
to
explore
administration
of
states
wealth
with
political
signifying
Greek
word
polity
and
economy
signifying
Greek
word
household
management
The
earliest
works
of
political
economy
are
usually
attributed
to
British
scholars
Adam
Smith
Thomas
Malthus
and
David
Ricardo
although
they
were
preceded
by
work
of
French
physiocrats
such
as
Franois
Quesnay
and
AnneRobertJacques
Turgot
In
late
th
century
term
economics
gradually
began
to
replace
term
political
economy
with
rise
of

term
economics
usually
refers
to
narrow
study
of
economy
absent
other
political
and
social
considerations
while
term
political
economy
represents
distinct
and
competing
approach
Political

where
it
isnt
considered
synonym
for

may
refer
to
very
different
things
From
academic
standpoint
term
may
reference
Marxian

applied
public

approaches
emanating
from
Chicago
school
and
Virginia
school
In
common
parlance
political

may
simply
refer
to
advice
given
by
economists
to
government
or
public
on
general
economic
policy
or
on
specific
economic
proposals
developed
by
political
scientists
A
rapidly
growing
mainstream
literature
from
s
has
expanded
beyond
model
of
economic
policy
in
which
planners
maximize
utility
of
representative
individual
toward
examining
how
political
forces
affect
choice
of
economic
policies
especially
as
to
distributional
conflicts

Etymologyedit
Originally
political
economy
meant
study
of
conditions
under
which
production
or
consumption
within
limited
parameters
was
organized
in
nationstates
In
that
way
political
economy
expanded
emphasis
of
economics
which
comes
from
Greek
oikos
meaning
home
and
nomos
meaning
law
or
order
Political
economy
was
thus
meant
to
express
laws
of
production
of
wealth
at
state
level
quite
like
economics
concerns
putting
home
to
order
The
phrase
conomie
politique
translated
in
English
to
political
economy
first
appeared
in
France
in
with
wellknown
book

on
making
distinction
between
profit
and
sustenance
in
modern
political
economy
terms
surplus
and
that
required
for
reproduction
of
classes
respectively
He
also
calls
for
creation
of
science
to
explain
society
and
goes
on
to
outline
these
ideas
in
his
major
work

Susan
Strange

A
ratherrecent
focus
has
been
put
on
modeling
economic
policy
and
political
institutions
concerning
interactions
between
agents
and
economic
and
political
institutions
including
seeming
discrepancy
of
economic
policy
and
economists
recommendations
through
lens
of

Other
important
landmarks
in

of
political

include
New
political
economy
which
may
treat
economic
ideologies
as
phenomenon
to
explain
per
traditions
of
Marxian
political
economy
Thus
Charles
S
Maier
suggests
that
political
economy
approach
interrogates
economic
doctrines
to
disclose
their
sociological
and
political
premises
in
sum
it
regards
economic
ideas
and
behavior
not
as
frameworks
for
analysis
but
as
beliefs
and
actions
that
must
themselves
be
explained

used

that
emerge
primarily
at
level
of

but
also
within

Main

history
of

thinking
The
political
history
of
world
is
history
of
changes
of
political
events
Aspects
of
Political
Historyedit
The
first
scientific
political
history
was
written
by
Leopold
von
Ranke
in
Germany
in
th
century
His
methodologies
profoundly
affected
way
historians
critically
examine
sources
see
historiography
for
more
complete
analysis
of
methodology
of
various
approaches
to
history
An
important
aspect
of
political
history
is
study
of
ideology
as
force
for
historical
change
One
author
asserts
that
political
history
as
whole
cannot
exist
without
study
of
ideological
differences
and
their
implications
Studies
of
political
history
typically
centre
around
single
nation
and
its
political
change
and
development
Some
historians
identify
growing
trend
towards
narrow
specialization
in
political
history
during
recent
decades
while
college
professor
in
s
sought
to
identify
himself
as
historian
by
s
American
historian
was
designation
From
s
onwards
new
movements
challenged
traditional
approaches
to
political
history
The
development
of
social
history
shifted
emphasis
away
from
study
of
leaders
and
national
decisions
and
towards
role
of
ordinary
people
especially
outsiders
and
minorities
Younger
scholars
shifted
to
different
issues
usually
focused
on
race
class
and
gender
with
little
room
for
elites
After
social
history
itself
began
to
fade
replaced
with
postmodern
and
cultural
approaches
that
rejected
grand
narrative
United
States
The
new
political
historyedit
Traditional
political
history
focused
on
major
leaders
and
had
long
played
dominant
role
among
academic
historians
in
United
States
These
studies
accounted
for
about
of
scholarly
books
and
articles
written
by
American
historians
before
and
about
into
s
followed
by
diplomacy
The
arrival
in
s
and
s
of
new
interest
in
social
history
led
to
emergence
of
new
political
history
which
saw
young
scholars
put
much
more
emphasis
on
voters
behavior
and
motivation
rather
than
just
politicians
It
relied
heavily
on
quantitative
methods
to
integrate
social
themes
especially
regarding
ethnicity
and
religion
The
new
social
science
approach
was
harbinger
of
fading
away
of
interest
in
Great
Men
The
eclipse
of
traditional
political
approaches
during
s
was
major
shock
though
diplomatic
history
fell
even
further
It
was
upstaged
by
social
history
with
raceclassgender
model
The
number
of
political
articles
submitted
to
Journal
of
American
History
fell
by
half
from
to
Patterson
argued
that
contemporary
events
especially
Vietnam
War
and
Watergate
alienated
younger
scholars
away
from
study
of
politicians
and
their
deeds
Political
history
never
disappeared
but
it
never
recovered
its
dominance
among
scholars
despite
its
sustained
high
popularity
among
reading
public
Some
political
historians
made
fun
of
their
own
predicament
as
when
William
Leuchtenburg
wrote
status
of
political
historians
within
profession
has
sunk
to
somewhere
between
that
of
faith
healer
and
chiropractor
Political
historians
were
all
right
in
way
but
you
might
not
want
to
bring
one
home
to
meet
family
Others
were
more
analytical
as
when
Hugh
Davis
Graham
observed
The
ranks
of
traditional
political
historians
are
depleted
their
assumptions
and
methods
discredited
along
with
Great
White
Man
whose
careers
they
chronicled
Britainedit
Readman
discusses
historiography
of
British
political
history
in
th
century
He
describes
how
British
political
scholarship
mostly
ignored
th
century
history
due
to
temporal
proximity
to
recent
past
unavailability
of
primary
sources
and
potential
for
bias
The
article
explores
how
transitions
in
scholarship
have
allowed
for
greater
interest
in
th
century
history
among
scholars
which
include
less
reliance
on
archival
sources
methodological
changes
in
historiography
and
flourishing
of
new
forms
of
history
such
as
oral
history
Germanyedit
In
course
of
s
however
some
German
historians
notably
HansUlrich
Wehler
and
his
cohort
began
to
rebel
against
this
idea
instead
suggesting
Primacy
of
Domestic
Politics
Primat
der
Innenpolitik
in
which
insecurities
of
in
this
case
German
domestic
policy
drove
creation
of
foreign
policy
This
led
to
considerable
body
of
work
interpreting
domestic
policies
of
various
states
and
ways
this
influenced
their
conduct
of
foreign
policy
Franceedit
The
French
Annales
School
had
already
put
emphasis
on
role
of
geography
and
economics
on
history
and
of
importance
of
broad
slow
cycles
rather
than
constant
apparent
movement
of
history
of
events
of
high
politics
It
downplayed
politics
and
diplomacy
The
most
important
work
of
Annales
school
Fernand
Braudels
The
Mediterranean
and
Mediterranean
World
in
Age
of
Philip
II
contains
traditional
Rankean
diplomatic
history
of
Philip
IIs
Mediterranean
policy
but
only
as
third
and
shortest
section
of
work
largely
focusing
on
broad
cycles
of
history
in
longue
dure
long
term
The
Annales
were
broadly
influential
leading
to
turning
away
from
political
history
towards
emphasis
on
broader
trends
of
economic
and
environmental
change
Social
historyedit
Main

Social
history
In
s
and
s
increasing
emphasis
on
giving
voice
to
voiceless
and
writing
history
of
underclasses
whether
by
using
quantitative
statistical
methods
of
social
history
or
more
postmodern
assessments
of
cultural
history
also
undermined
centrality
of
politics
to

Leff
noted
how
social

disdained
political

as
elitist
shallow
altogether

The
political
history
of
world
is
history
of
various
political

race
throughout
their
existence
and
way
these
states
define
their
borders
Throughout
history
political
entities
have
expanded
from
basic
systems
of
selfgovernance
and
monarchy
to
complex
democratic
and
totalitarian
systems
that
exist
today
In

Prehistoric

The
first
forms
of
human
social
organization
were
families
living
in
band
societies
as
huntergatherers
After
invention
of
agriculture
around
same
time
BCE
across
various
parts
of
world
human
societies
started
transitioning
to
tribal
forms
of
organization
There
is
evidence
of
diplomacy
between
different
tribes
but
also
of
endemic
warfare
This
could
have
been
caused
by
theft
of
livestock
or
crops
abduction
of
women
or
resource
and
status
competition
Ancient
historyedit
Main

Ancient
history
The
early
distribution
of
political
power
was
determined
by
availability
of
fresh
water
fertile
soil
and
temperate
climate
of
different
locations
These
were
all
necessary
for
development
of
highly
organized
societies
The
first
empires
were
those
of
Ancient
Egypt
and
Mesopotamia
Smaller
kingdoms
existed
in
North
China
Plain
IndoGangetic
Plain
Central
Asia
Anatolia
Eastern
Mediterranean
and
Central
America
while
rest
of
humanity
continued
to
live
in
small
tribes
Both
Egypt
and
Mesopotamia
had
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
their
large
rivers
with
irrigation
systems
enabling
higher
productivity
in
agriculture
and
thereby
sustaining
surpluses

of
Egyptians
had
them

Definitionedit
According
to
David
Easton
A
political
system
can
be
designated
as
interactions
through
which
values
are
authoritatively
allocated
for
society
Anthropological
classificationedit
Anthropologists
generally
recognize
four
kinds
of
political
systems
two
of
which
are
uncentralized
and
two
of
which
are
centralized
Uncentralized
systems
Band
society
Small
family
group
no
larger
than
extended
family
or
clan
it
has
been
defined
as
consisting
of
no
more
than
to
individuals
A
band
can
cease
to
exist
if
only
small
group
walks
out
Tribe
Generally
larger
consisting
of
many
families
Tribes
have
more
social
institutions
such
as
chief
or
elders
More
permanent
than
bands
Many
tribes
are
subdivided
into
bands
Centralized
governments
Chiefdom
More
complex
than
tribe
or
band
society
and
less
complex
than
state
or
civilization
Characterized
by
pervasive
inequality
and
centralization
of
authority
A
single
lineagefamily
of
elite
class
becomes
ruling
elite
of
chiefdom
Complex
chiefdoms
have
two
or
even
three
tiers
of
political
hierarchy
An
autonomous
political
unit
comprising
number
of
villages
or
communities
under
permanent
control
of
paramount
chief
Sovereign
state
A
sovereign
state
is
state
with
permanent
population
defined
territory
government
and
capacity
to
enter
into
relations
with
other
sovereign
states
Supranational
political
systems
Supranational
political
systems
are
created
by
independent
nations
to
reach
common
goal
or
gain
strength
from
forming
alliance
Empires
Empires
are
widespread
states
or
communities
under
single
rule
They
are
characterized
by
rulers
desire
for
unanimous
religious
affiliation
or
posing
as
threat
to
other
empires
in
times
of
war
Empires
such
as
Romans
or
Americans
often
made
considerable
progress
in
ways
of
democratic
structures
creating
and
building
city
infrastructures
and
maintaining
civility
within
diverse
communities
Because
of
intricate
organization
of
empires
they
were
often
able
to
hold
large
majority
of
power
on
universal
level
Leagues
Leagues
are
international
organizations
composed
of
states
coming
together
for
single
common
purpose
In
this
way
leagues
are
different
from
empires
as
they
only
seek
to
fulfill
single
goal
Often
leagues
are
formed
on
brink
of
military
or
economic
downfall
Meetings
and
hearings
are
conducted
in
neutral
location
with
representatives
of
all
involved
nations
present
Sociologyedit
The
sociological
interest
in
political
systems
is
figuring
out
who
holds
power
within
relationship
of
government
and
its
people
and
how
governments
power
is
used
There
are
three
types
of
political
systems
that
sociologists
consider
Authoritarianism
In
authoritarian
governments
people
have
no
power
or
representation
and
it
is
characterized
by
absolute
or
blind
obedience
to
formal
authority
as
against
individual
freedom
and
related
to
expectation
of
unquestioning
obedience
The
elite
leaders
handle
all
economic
military
and
foreign
relations
A
prime
example
of
authoritarianism
is
dictatorship
Totalitarianism
is
most
extreme
form
of
authoritarianism
because
it
controls
all
aspects
of
life
including
communication
between
citizens
media
censorship
and
threatens
by
means
of
terror
Monarchy
A
monarchy
is
government
controlled
by
king
or
queen
determined
by
predisposed
line
of
sovereignty
In
other
words
it
can
be
seen
as
undivided
rule
or
absolute
sovereignty
by
single
person
In
modern
world
there
are
two
types
of
monarchies
absolute
monarchies
and
constitutional
monarchies
An
absolute
monarchy
works
like
dictatorship
in
that
king
has
complete
rule
over
his
country
A
constitutional
monarchy
gives
royal
family
limited
powers
and
usually
works
in
accordance
with
elected
body
of
officials
Social
revolutions
of
th
th
and
th
century
overthrew
majoritycitation
needed
of
existing
monarchies
in
favor
of
more
democratic
governments
and
rising
middle
class
as
well
as
of
authoritarian
regimes
like
Soviet
Union
Democracy
A
democracy
is
form
of
government
in
which
citizens
create
and
vote
for
laws
directly
or
indirectly
via
representatives
democratic
republic
The
idea
of
democracy
stems
back
from
ancient
Greece
and
profound
works
of
ancient
academics
However
presence
of
democracy
does
not
always
mean
citizens
wishes
will
be
equally
represented
For
example
in
many
democratic
countrieswhich
immigrants
and
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
do
not
receive
same
rightsclarification
needed
as
majority
citizensaccording
to
whom

Anarchy
is
state
of
society
being
freely
constituted
without
authorities
or
governing
body
It
may
also
refer
to
society
or
group
of
people
that
entirely
rejects
set
hierarchy
Anarchy
was
first
used
in
meaning
absence
of
government
PierreJoseph
Proudhon
adopted
anarchy
and
anarchist
in
his
treatise
What
Is
Property
to
refer
to
anarchism
new
political
philosophy
and
social
movement
which
advocates
stateless
societies
based
on
free
and
voluntary
associations
Anarchists
seek
system
based
on
abolishment
of
all
unjustified
coercitive
hierarchy
and
creation
of
system
of
direct
democracy
and
worker
cooperatives
In
practical
terms
anarchy
can
refer
to
curtailment
or
abolition
of
traditional
forms
of
government
and
institutions
It
can
also
designate
nation
or
any
inhabited
place
that
has
no
system
of
government
or
central
rule
Anarchy
is
primarily
advocated
by
individual
anarchists
who
propose
replacing
government
with
voluntary
institutions
These
true
institutions
or
associations
generally
are
modeled
on
nature
since
they
can
represent
concepts
such
as
community
and
economic
selfreliance
interdependence
or
individualism
Although
anarchy
is
often
negatively
used
as
synonym
of
chaos
or
societal
collapse
this
is
not
meaning
that
anarchists
attribute
to
anarchy
society
without
hierarchies
Proudhon
wrote
that
anarchy
is

CircleA
anarchist
symbol
Although
most
known
societies
are
characterized
by
presence
of
hierarchy
or
state
anthropologists
have
studied
many
egalitarian
stateless
societies
including
most
nomadic
huntergatherer
societies
and
horticultural
societies
such
as
Semai
and
Piaroa
Many
of
these
societies
can
be
considered
to
be
anarchic
in
sense
that
they
explicitly
reject
idea
of
centralized
political
authority
The
egalitarianism
typical
of
human
huntergatherers
is
interesting
when
viewed
in
evolutionary
context
One
of
humanitys
two
closest
primate
relatives
chimpanzee
is
anything
but
egalitarian
forming
hierarchies
that
are
dominated
by
alpha
males
So
great
is
contrast
with
human
huntergatherers
that
it
is
widely
argued
by
palaeoanthropologists
that
resistance
to
being
dominated
was
key
factor
driving
development
of
human
consciousness
language
kinship
and
social
organization
In
Fragments
of
Anarchist
Anthropology
anarchist
anthropologist
David
Graeber
attempted
to
outline
areas
of
research
that
intellectuals
might
explore
in
creating
cohesive
body
of
anarchist
social
theory
Graeber
posited
that
anthropology
is
particularly
well
positioned
as
academic
discipline
that
can
look
at
gamut
of
human
societies
and
organizations
to
study
analyze
and
catalog
alternative
social
and
economic
structures
around
world
and
most
importantly
present
these
alternatives
to
world
In
Society
Against
State
Pierre
Clastres
examined
stateless
societies
where
certain
cultural
practices
and
attitudes
avert
development
of
hierarchy
and
state
Clastres
dismissed
notion
that
state
is
natural
outcome
of
evolution
of
human
societies
In
The
Art
of
Not
Being
Governed
James
C
Scott
studied
Zomia
vast
stateless
upland
region
on
Southeast
Asia
The
hills
of
Zomia
isolate
it
from
lowland
states
and
create
refuge
for
people
to
escape
to
Scott
argues
that
particular
social
and
cultural
characteristics
of
hill
people
were
adapted
to
escape
capture
by
lowland
states
and
should
not
be
viewed
as
relics
of
barbarism
abandoned
by
civilization
Peter
Leeson
examined
variety
of
institutions
of
private
law
enforcement
developed
in
anarchic
situations
by
eighteenth
century
pirates
preliterate
tribesmen
and
Californian
prison
gangs
These
groups
all
adapted
different
methods
of
private
law
enforcement
to
meet
their
specific
needs
and
particulars
of
their
anarchic
situation
Anarchoprimitivists
base
their
critique
of
civilization
partly
on
anthropological
studies
of
nomadic
huntergatherers
noting
that
shift
towards
domestication
has
likely
caused
increases
in
disease
labor
inequality
warfare
and
psychological
disorders
Authors
such
as
John
Zerzan
have
argued
that
negative
stereotypes
of
primitive
societies
eg
that
they
are
typically
extremely
violent
or
impoverished
are
used
to
justify
values
of
modern
industrial
society
and
to
move
individuals
further
away
from
more
natural
and
equitable
conditions
International
relations
In
international
relations
anarchy
is
absence
of
any
authority
superior
to
nationstates
and
capable
of
arbitrating
their
disputes
and
enforcing
international
law

Anarchism
As
political
philosophy
anarchism
advocates
selfgoverned
societies
based
on
voluntary
institutions
These
are
often
described
as
stateless
societies
although
several
authors
have
defined
them
more
specifically
as
institutions
based
on
nonhierarchical
free
associations
Anarchism
holds
state
to
be
undesirable
unnecessary
or
harmful
While
opposition
to
state
is
central
it
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
condition
hence
why
in
spite
of
their
names
anarchocapitalism
and
nationalanarchism
are
either
not
recognized
as
anarchist
schools
of
thought
and
as
part
of
anarchist
movement
or
are
seen
by
anarchists
and
scholars
as
fraudulent
and
oxymoron
Anarchism
entails
opposing
authority
or
hierarchical
organisation
in
conduct
of
all
human
relations
including
yet
not
limited
to
state
system
There
are
many
types
and
traditions
of
anarchism
not
all
of
which
are
mutually
exclusive
Anarchist
schools
of
thought
can
differ
fundamentally
supporting
anything
from
extreme
individualism
to
complete
collectivism
Strains
of
anarchism
have
been
divided
into
categories
of
individualist
and
social
anarchism
or
similar
dual
classifications
Anarchism
is
often
considered
to
be
radical
leftwing
or
farleft
movement
and
much
of
anarchist
economics
and
anarchist
law
reflect
antiauthoritarian
antistatist
and
libertarian
interpretations
of
leftwing
and
socialist
politics
such
communism
mutualism
and
syndicalism
among
other
libertarian
socialist
and
socialist
economics
such
as
collectivist
anarchism
freemarket
anarchism
green
anarchism
and
participatory
economics
Within
anarchism
some
individualist
anarchists
are
communists
while
some
anarchocommunists
are
egoists
or
individualists
Where
individualist
forms
of
anarchism
emphasize
personal
autonomy
and
rational
nature
of
human
beings
social
anarchism
sees
individual
freedom
as
conceptually
connected
with
social
equality
and
emphasize
community
and
mutual
aid
In
European
Socialism
A
History
of
Ideas
and
Movements
Carl
Landauer
summarized
difference
between
communist
and
individualist
anarchists
by
stating
that
communist
anarchists
also
do
not
acknowledge
any
right
to
society
to
force
individual
They
differ
from
anarchistic
individualists
in
their
belief
that
men
if
freed
from
coercion
will
enter
into
voluntary
associations
of
communistic
type
while
other
wing
believes
that
free
person
will
prefer
high
degree
of
isolation
As
social
movement
anarchism
has
regularly
endured
fluctuations
in
popularity
The
central
tendency
of
anarchism
as
mass
social
movement
has
been
represented
by
anarchocommunism
and
anarchosyndicalism
with
individualist
anarchism
being
primarily
literary
phenomenon
while
social
anarchism
has
been
dominant
form
of
anarchism
emerging
in
late
th
century
as
distinction
from
individualist
anarchism
after
anarchocommunism
replaced
collectivist
anarchism
as
dominant
tendency
Nonetheless
individualist
anarchism
did
influence
bigger
currents
and
individualists
also
participated
in
large
anarchist
organizations
Some
anarchists
are
pacifists
who
support
selfdefense
or
nonviolence
anarchopacifism
while
others
have
supported
use
of
militant
measures
including
revolution
and
propaganda
of
deed
on
path
to
anarchist
society
Since
s
term
libertarianism
has
been
used
as
synonym
for
anarchism
and
was
used
almost
exclusively
in
this
sense
until
midth
century
development
of
rightlibertarianism
in
United
States
where
classical
liberals
began
to
describe
themselves
as
libertarians
It
has
since
become
necessary
to
distinguish
their
classical
liberal
individualist
and
freemarket
capitalist
philosophy
from
anarchism
The
former
is
often
referred
to
as
rightlibertarianism
whereas
latter
is
described
by
terms
leftlibertarianism
libertarian
socialism
and
socialist
libertarianism
Rightlibertarians
are
divided
into
anarchocapitalists
minarchists
and
voluntaryists
Outside

generally
retains

treated
anarchy
in
his
Anthropology
from
Pragmatic
Point
of
View
as
consisting
of
Law
and
Freedom
without
Force
For
Kant
anarchy
falls
short
of
being
true
civil
state
because
law
is
only
empty
recommendation
if
force
is
not
included
to
make
this
law
efficacious
legitimation
etymologically
fancifully
from
legem
timere
ie
fearing
law
For
there
to
be
such
state
force
must
be
included
while
law
and
freedom
are
maintained
state
which
Kant
calls
republic
Kant
identified
four
kinds
of
government
Law
and
freedom
without
force
anarchy
Law
and
force
without
freedom
despotism
Force
without

and

Anarchy
was

of

at
Putney
Debates
of
Thomas
Rainsborough
I
shall
now
be
little
more
free
and
open
with
you
than
I
was
before
I
wish
we
were
all
truehearted
and
that
we
did
all
carry
ourselves
with
integrity
If
I
did
mistrust
you
I
would
not
use
such
asseverations
I
think
it
doth
go
on
mistrust
and
things
are
thought
too
readily
matters
of
reflection
that
were
never
intended
For
my
part
as
I
think
you
forgot
something
that
was
in
my
speech
and
you
do
not
only
yourselves
believe
that
some
men
believe
that
government
is
never
correct
but
you
hate
all
men
that
believe
that
And
sir
to
say
because
man
pleads
that
every
man
hath
voice
by
right
of
nature
that
therefore
it
destroys
by
same
argument
all
property
this
is
to
forget
Law
of
God
That
theres
property
Law
of
God
says
it
else
why
hath
God
made
that
law
Thou
shalt
not
steal
I
am
poor
man
therefore
I
must
be
oppressed
if
I
have
no
interest
in
kingdom
I
must
suffer
by
all
their
laws
be
they
right
or
wrong
Nay
thus
gentleman
lives
in
country
and
hath
three
or
four
lordships
as
some
men
have
God
knows
how
they
got
them
and
when
Parliament
is
called
he
must
be
Parliamentman
and
it
may
be
he
sees
some
poor
men
they
live
near
this
man
he
can
crush
them
I
have
known
invasion
to
make
sure
he
hath
turned
poor
men
out
of
doors
and
I
would
fain
know
whether
potency
of
rich
men
do
not
this
and
so
keep
them
under
greatest
tyranny
that
was
ever
thought
of
in
world
And
therefore
I
think
that
to
that
it
is
fully
answered
God
hath
set
down
that
thing
as
to
propriety
with
this
law
of
his
Thou
shalt
not
steal
And
for
my
part
I
am
against
any
such
thought
and
as
for
yourselves
I
wish
you
would
not
make
world
believe
that
we
are
for
anarchy
Oliver
Cromwell
I
know
nothing
but
this
that
they
that
are
most
yielding
have
greatest
wisdom
but
really
sir
this
is
not
right
as
it
should
be
No
man
says
that
you
have
mind
to
anarchy
but
that
consequence
of
this
rule
tends
to
anarchy
must
end
in
anarchy
for
where
is
there
any
bound
or
limit
set
if
you
take
away
this
limit
that
men
that
have
no
interest
but
interest
of
breathing
shall
have
no
voice
in
elections
Therefore
I
am
confident
ont
we
should
not
be
so
hot
one
with
another
As
people
began
to
theorize
about
English
Civil
War
anarchy
came
to
be
more
sharply
defined
albeit
from
differing
political
perspectives
Thomas
Hobbes
Leviathan
describes
natural
condition
of
mankind
as
war
of
all
against
all
where
man
lives
brutish
existence
For
savage
people
in
many
places
of
America
except
government
of
small
families
concord
whereof
dependeth
on
natural
lust
have
no
government
at
all
and
live
at
this
day
in
that
brutish
manner
Hobbes
finds
three
basic
causes
of
conflict
in
this
state
of
nature
namely
competition
diffidence
and
glory
The
first
maketh
men
invade
for
gain
second
for
safety
and
third
for
reputation
His
first
law
of
nature
is
that
every
man
ought
to
endeavour
peace
as
far
as
he
has
hope
of
obtaining
it
and
when
he
cannot
obtain
it
that
he
may
seek
and
use
all
helps
and
advantages
of
war
In
state
of
nature
every
man
has
right
to
every
thing
even
to
then
go
for
one
anothers
body
but
second
law
is
that
in
order
to
secure
advantages
of
peace
that
man
be
willing
when
others
are
so
too
to
lay
down
this
right
to
all
things
and
be
contented
with
so
much
liberty
against
other
men
as
he
would
allow
other
men
against
himself
This
is
beginning
of
contractscovenants
performing
of
which
is
third
law
of
nature
Therefore
injustice
is
failure
to
perform
in
covenant
and
all
else
is
just
James
Harrington
The
Commonwealth
of
Oceana
uses
term
to
describe
situation
where
people
use
force
to
impose
government
on
economic
base
composed
of
either
solitary
land
ownership
absolute
monarchy
or
land
in
ownership
of
few
mixed
monarchy
He
distinguishes
it
from
commonwealth
situation
when
both
land
ownership
and
governance
shared
by
population
at
large
seeing
it
as
temporary
situation
arising
from
imbalance
between
form
of
government
and
form
of
property

Armand
duc
dAiguillon
came
before
National
Assembly
and
shared
his
views
on
anarchy
I
may
be
permitted
here
to
express
my
personal
opinion
I
shall
no
doubt
not
be
accused
of
not
loving
liberty
but
I
know
that
not
all
movements
of
peoples
lead
to
liberty
But
I
know
that
great
anarchy
quickly
leads
to
great
exhaustion
and
that
despotism
which
is
kind
of
rest
has
almost
always
been
necessary
result
of
great
anarchy
It
is
therefore
much
more
important
than
we
think
to
end
disorder
under
which
we
suffer
If
we
can
achieve
this
only
through
use
of
force
by
authorities
then
it
would
be
thoughtless
to
keep
refraining
from
using
such
force
Armand
was

exiled
because
he
was
viewed
as

takes

her
enemies

first
those

her
both
as

as
end
of
progress
opposing
her
openly
avowedly
sincerely
consistently
universally
second
those
who
profess
to
believe
in
her
as
means
of
progress
but
who
accept
her
only
so
far
as
they
think
she
will
subserve
their
own
selfish
interests
denying
her
and
her
blessings
to
rest
of

third
those
who
distrust
her
as
means
of
progress
believing
in
her
only
as
end
to
be
obtained
by
first
trampling
upon
violating
and
outraging

These
three
phases
of
opposition
to

are
met
in

The

is
primarily
socialist

is

exploitation

man
Anarchism
is
only
one
of
streams

thought
that
stream
whose

components
are
concern
for
liberty
and
haste
to
abolish
State
In
general
anarchism
is
closer
to
socialism
than
liberalism
Anarchism
finds
itself
largely
in
socialist
camp
but
it
also
has
outriders
in

It
cannot
be
reduced
to
socialism
and
is
best
seen
as

Anarchocapitalists
are
against
State
simply
because
they
are
capitalists
first
and
foremost
They
are
not
concerned
with
social
consequences
of
capitalism
for
weak
powerless
and
ignorant
As
such
anarchocapitalism
overlooks
egalitarian
implications
of
traditional
individualist
anarchists
like
Spooner
and
Tucker
In
fact
few
anarchists
would
accept
anarchocapitalists
into
anarchist
camp
since
they
do
not
share
concern
for
economic
equality
and
social
justice
Their
selfinterested
calculating
market
men
would
be
incapable
of
practising
voluntary
cooperation
and
mutual
aid
Anarchocapitalists
even
if
they
do
reject
state
might
therefore
best
be
called
rightwing
libertarians
rather
than
anarchists

Libertarian
and
libertarianism
are
frequently
employed
by
anarchists
as
synonyms
for
anarchist
and
anarchism
largely
as
attempt
to
distance
themselves
from
negative
connotations
of
anarchy
and
its
derivatives
The
situation
has
been
vastly
complicated
in
recent
decades
with
rise
of
anarchocapitalism
minimal
statism
and
extreme
rightwing
laissezfaire
philosophy
advocated
by
such
theorists
as
Rothbard
and
Nozick
and
their
adoption
of
words
libertarian
and
libertarianism
It
has
therefore
now
become
necessary
to
distinguish
between
their
right
libertarianism
and
left
libertarianism
of
anarchist
tradition

It
is
important
to
distinguish
between
anarchism
and
certain
strands
of

libertarianism

go

example

For
long
time
libertarian
was
interchangeable
in
France
with
anarchist
but
in
recent
years
its
meaning
has
become
more
ambivalent
In
general
anarchism
is
closer
to
socialism
than
liberalism
Anarchism
finds
itself
largely
in
socialist
camp
but
it
also
has
outriders
in
liberalism
It
cannot
be
reduced
to
socialism
and
is
best
seen
as
separate
and
distinctive
doctrine

if

places
without

we
define

as

whatever
else

A
citystate
is
independent
sovereign
city
which
serves
as
center
of
political
economic
and
cultural
life
over
its
contiguous
territory
They
have
existed
in
many
parts
of
world
since
dawn
of
history
including
cities
such
as
Rome
Athens
Sparta
Carthage
and
Italian
citystates
during
Middle
Ages
and
Renaissance
such
as
Florence
Venice
Genoa
and
Milan
With
rise
of
nation
states
worldwide
only
few
modern
sovereign
citystates
exist
with
some
disagreement
as
to
which
qualify
Monaco
Singapore
and
Vatican
City
are
most
commonly
accepted
as
such
Singapore
is
clearest
example
with
full
selfgovernance
its
own
currency
robust
military
and
population
of
million
A
number
of
other
small
states
share
many
of
these
characteristics
and
are
sometimes
cited
as
modern
citystates
Qatar
Brunei
Kuwait
Bahrain
and
Malta
each
have
urban
center
comprising
significant
proportion
of
population
though
each
has
more
than
one
distinct
municipality
with
one
identified
as
capital
city
Occasionally
microstates
with
high
population
densities
such
as
San
Marino
are
cited
despite
lacking
large
urban
centre
Several
nonsovereign
cities
enjoy
high
degree
of
autonomy
and
are
sometimes
considered
citystates
Macau
Hong
Kong
and
members
of
United
Arab
Emirates
most
notably
Dubai
and
Abu
Dhabi
are
often
cited
as
such

prevented
their

However
such
small
political
entities
often
survived
only
for
short
periods
because
they
lacked
resources
to
defend
themselves
against
incursions
by
larger

Democracy
Greek
dmokrati
from
dmos
people
and
kratos
rule
is
form
of
government
in
which
people
have
authority
to
choose
their
governing
legislators
The
decisions
on
who
is
considered
part
of
people
and
how
authority
is
shared
among
or
delegated
by
people
have
changed
over
time
and
at
different
speeds
in
different
countries
but
they
have
included
more
and
more
of
inhabitants
of
all
countries
Cornerstones
include
freedom
of
assembly
and
speech
inclusiveness
and
equality
membership
consent
voting
right
to
life
and
minority
rights
The
notion
of
democracy
has
evolved
over
time
considerably
and
generally
two
current
types
of
democracy
are
direct
and
representative
In
direct
democracy
people
directly
deliberate
and
decide
on
legislation
In
representative
democracy
people
elect
representatives
to
deliberate
and
decide
on
legislation
such
as
in
parliamentary
or
presidential
democracy
Liquid
democracy
combines
elements
of
these
two
basic
types
Prevalent
daytoday
decision
making
of
democracies
is
majority
rule
though
other
decision
making
approaches
like
supermajority
and
consensus
have
been
equally
integral
to
democracies
They
serve
crucial
purpose
of
inclusiveness
and
broader
legitimacy
on
sensitive
issues
counterbalancing
majoritarianism
and
therefore
mostly
take
precedence
on
constitutional
level
In
common
variant
of
liberal
democracy
powers
of
majority
are
exercised
within
framework
of
representative
democracy
but
constitution
limits
majority
and
protects
minority
usually
through
enjoyment
by
all
of
certain
individual
rights
eg
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
association
Besides
these
general
types
of
democracy
there
have
been
wealth
of
further
types
see
below
Democracy
makes
all
forces
struggle
repeatedly
to
realize
their
interests
and
devolves
power
from
groups
of
people
to
sets
of
rules
Western
democracy
as
distinct
from
that
which
existed
in
antiquity
is
generally
considered
to
have
originated
in
citystates
such
as
Classical
Athens
and
Roman
Republic
where
various
schemes
and
degrees
of
enfranchisement
of
free
male
population
were
observed
before
form
disappeared
in
West
at
beginning
of
late
antiquity
The
English
word
dates
back
to
th
century
from
older
Middle
French
and
Middle
Latin
equivalents
According
to
American
political
scientist
Larry
Diamond
democracy
consists
of
four
key
elements
political
system
for
choosing
and
replacing
government
through
free
and
fair
elections
active
participation
of
people
as
citizens
in
politics
and
civic
life
protection
of
human
rights
of
all
citizens
and
rule
of
law
in
which
laws
and
procedures
apply
equally
to
all
citizens
Todd
Landman
nevertheless
draws
our
attention
to
fact
that
democracy
and
human
rights
are
two
different
concepts
and
that
there
must
be
greater
specificity
in
conceptualisation
and
operationalisation
of
democracy
and
human
rights
The
term
appeared
in
th
century
BC
to
denote
political
systems
then
existing
in
Greek
citystates
notably
Athens
to
mean
rule
of
people
in
contrast
to
aristocracy
aristokrata
meaning
rule
of
elite
While
theoretically
these
definitions
are
in
opposition
in
practice
distinction
has
been
blurred
historically
The
political
system
of
Classical
Athens
for
example
granted
democratic
citizenship
to
free
men
and
excluded
slaves
and
women
from
political
participation
In
virtually
all
democratic
governments
throughout
ancient
and
modern
history
democratic
citizenship
consisted
of
elite
class
until
full
enfranchisement
was
won
for
all
adult
citizens
in
most
modern
democracies
through
suffrage
movements
of
th
and
th
centuries
Democracy
contrasts
with
forms
of
government
where
power
is
either
held
by
individual
as
in
absolute
monarchy
or
where
power
is
held
by
small
number
of
individuals
as
in
oligarchy
Nevertheless
these
oppositions
inherited
from
Greek
philosophy
are
now
ambiguous
because
contemporary
governments
have
mixed
democratic
oligarchic
and
monarchic
elements
Karl
Popper
defined
democracy
in
contrast
to
dictatorship
or
tyranny
thus
focusing
on
opportunities
for
people
to
control
their
leaders
and
to
oust
them
without
need
for
revolution

No

on
how
to
define

indeed
one
study
found
that
at
least
descriptions
of
democracy
exist
in
English
language
but
legal
equality
political
freedom
and
rule
of
law
have
been
identified
as
important
characteristics
These
principles
are
reflected
in
all
eligible
citizens
being
equal
before
law
and
having
equal
access
to
legislative
processescitation

For
example
in
representative
democracy
every
vote
has
equal
weight
no
unreasonable
restrictions
can
apply
to
anyone
seeking
to
become
representativeaccording
to
whom
and
freedom
of
its
eligible
citizens
is
secured
by
legitimised
rights
and
liberties
which
are
typically
protected
by
constitution
Other
uses
of
democracy
include
that
of
direct
democracy
One
theory
holds
that
democracy
requires
three
fundamental
principles
upward
control
sovereignty
residing
at
lowest
levels
of
authority
political
equality
and
social
norms
by
which
individuals
and
institutions
only
consider
acceptable
acts
that
reflect
first
two
principles
of
upward
control
and
political
equality
The
term
democracy
is
sometimes
used
as
shorthand
for
liberal
democracy
which
is
variant
of
representative
democracy
that
may
include
elements
such
as
political
pluralism
equality
before
law
right
to
petition
elected
officials
for
redress
of
grievances
due
process
civil
liberties
human
rights
and
elements
of
civil
society
outside
governmentcitation
needed
Roger
Scruton
argues
that
democracy
alone
cannot
provide
personal
and
political
freedom
unless
institutions
of
civil
society
are
also
present
In
some
countries
notably
in
United
Kingdom
which
originated
Westminster
system
dominant
principle
is
that
of
parliamentary
sovereignty
while
maintaining
judicial
independence
In
India
parliamentary
sovereignty
is
subject
to
Constitution
of
India
which
includes
judicial
review
Though
term
democracy
is
typically
used
in
context
of
political
state
principles
also
are
applicable
to
private
organisations
There
are
many
decisionmaking
methods
used
in
democracies
but
majority
rule
is
dominant
form
Without
compensation
like
legal
protections
of
individual
or
group
rights
political
minorities
can
be
oppressed
by
tyranny
of
majority
Majority
rule
is
competitive
approach
opposed
to
consensus
democracy
creating
need
that
elections
and
generally
deliberation
are
substantively
and
procedurally
fair
ie
just
and
equitable
In
some
countries
freedom
of
political
expression
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
press
and
internet
democracy
are
considered
important
to
ensure
that
voters
are
well
informed
enabling
them
to
vote
according
to
their
own
interests
It
has
also
been
suggested
that
basic
feature
of
democracy
is
capacity
of
all
voters
to
participate
freely
and
fully
in
life
of
their
society
With
its
emphasis
on
notions
of
social
contract
and
collective
will
of
all
voters
democracy
can
also
be
characterised
as
form
of
political
collectivism
because
it
is
defined
as
form
of
government
in
which
all
eligible
citizens
have
equal
say
in
lawmaking
Republics
though
often
associated
with
democracy
because
of
shared
principle
of
rule
by
consent
of
governed
are
not
necessarily
democracies
as
republicanism
does
not
specify
how
people
are
to
rule
Classically
term
republic
encompassed
both
democracies
and
aristocracies
In
modern
sense
republican
form
of
government
is
form
of
government
without
monarch
Because
of
this
democracies
can
be
republics
or
constitutional
monarchies
such
as
United
Kingdom

Historically

At

If

Athenian
democracy
The
term
democracy
first
appeared
in
ancient
Greek
political
and
philosophical
thought
in
citystate
of
Athens
during
classical
antiquity
The
word
comes
from
demos
common
people
and
kratos
strength
Led
by
Cleisthenes
Athenians
established
what
is
generally
held
as
first
democracy
in
BC
Cleisthenes
is
referred
to
as
father
of
Athenian
democracy
Athenian
democracy
took
form
of
direct
democracy
and
it
had
two
distinguishing
features
random
selection
of
ordinary
citizens
to
fill
few
existing
government
administrative
and
judicial
offices
and
legislative
assembly
consisting
of
all
Athenian
citizens
All
eligible
citizens
were
allowed
to
speak
and
vote
in
assembly
which
set
laws
of
city
state
However
Athenian
citizenship

Owning

it

The
exclusion
of
large
parts
of
population
from

body
is
closely
related
to
ancient
understanding

In

Athenian
democracy
was
not
only
direct
in
sense
that
decisions
were
made
by
assembled
people
but
also
most
direct
in
sense
that
people
through
assembly
boule
and
courts
of
law
controlled
entire
political
process
and
large
proportion
of
citizens
were
involved
constantly
in
public
business
Even
though
rights
of
individual
were
not
secured
by
Athenian
constitution
in
modern
sense
ancient
Greeks
had
no
word
for
rights
Athenians
enjoyed
their
liberties
not
in
opposition
to
government
but
by
living
in
city
that
was
not
subject
to
another
power
and
by
not
being
subjects
themselves
to
rule
of
another
person
Range

appeared
in
Sparta
as
early
as
BC
The
Apella
was
assembly
of

held
once
month
in
which
every
male
citizen
of
at

years
of

could

Aristotle
called

of
its

to
prevent
any
bias

buying
or
cheating
that
was
predominant
in
early
democratic

Even
though
Roman
Republic
contributed
significantly
to
many
aspects
of
democracy
only
minority
of
Romans
were
citizens
with
votes
in
elections
for
representatives
The
votes
of
powerful
were
given
more
weight
through
system
of
gerrymandering
so
most
high
officials
including
members
of
Senate
came
from
few
wealthy
and
noble
families
In

overthrow
of

was
first
case
in
Western
world
of

being
formed
with
explicit
purpose
of
being
republic
although
it
didnt
have
much
of
democracy
The
Roman
model
of
governance
inspired
many
political
thinkers
over
centuries
and
todays
modern
representative
democracies
imitate
more
Roman
than
Greek
models
because
it
was
state
in
which
supreme
power
was
held
by
people
and
their
elected
representatives
and
which
had
elected
or
nominated

While
most
regions
in
Europe
during
Middle
Ages
were
ruled
by
clergy

feudal
lords
there
existed
various
systems
involving

The

of

had
its
roots
in
restrictions
on

of
kings
written
into
Magna

which
explicitly
protected
certain
rights
of
Kings
subjects
and
implicitly
supported
what

However
power

Studies
have
linked

of
parliamentary
institutions
in
Europe
during

period
to
urban
agglomeration
and
creation
of

classes
such
as

interest
in

English
Civil

in
th

prompted
growth
of
political
philosophy
on
British
Isles
Thomas
Hobbes
was
first
philosopher
to
articulate
detailed
social
contract
theory
Writing
in
Leviathan
Hobbes
theorized
that
individuals
living
in
state
of
nature
led
lives
that
were
solitary
poor
nasty
brutish
and
short
and
constantly
waged
war
of
all
against
all
In
order
to
prevent
occurrence
of
anarchic
state
of
nature
Hobbes
reasoned
that
individuals
ceded
their
rights
to
strong
authoritarian
government
Later
philosopher
and
physician
John
Locke
would
posit
different
interpretation
of
social
contract
theory
Writing
in
his
Two
Treatises
of
Government
Locke
posited
that
all
individuals
possessed
inalienable
rights
to
life
liberty
and
estate
property
According
to
Locke
individuals
would
voluntarily
come
together
to
form
state
for
purposes
of
defending
their
rights
Particularly
important
for
Locke
were
property
rights
whose
protection
Locke
deemed
to
be
governments
primary
purpose
Furthermore
Locke
asserted
that
governments
were
legitimate
only
if
they
held
consent
of
governed
For
Locke
citizens
had
right
to
revolt
against
government
that
acted
against
their
interest
or
became
tyrannical
Although
they
were
not
widely
read
during
his
lifetime
Lockes
works
are
considered
founding
documents
of
liberal
thought
and
profoundly
influenced
leaders

Republics
though
often
associated
with
democracy
because
of
shared
principle
of
rule
by
consent
of
governed
are
not
necessarily
democracies
as
republicanism
does
not
specify
how
people
are
to
rule
Theoryedit
Early
theoryedit
Aristotle
contrasted
rule
by
many
democracytimocracy
with
rule
by
few
oligarchyaristocracy
and
with
rule
by
single
person
tyranny
or
today
autocracyabsolute
monarchy
He
also
thought
that
there
was
good
and
bad
variant
of
each
system
he
considered
democracy
to
be
degenerate
counterpart
to
timocracy
A
common
view
among
early
and
renaissance
Republican
theorists
was
that
democracy
could
only
survive
in
small
political
communities
Heeding
lessons
of
Roman
Republics
shift
to
monarchism
as
it
grew
larger
or
smaller
these
Republican
theorists
held
that
expansion
of
territory
and
population
inevitably
led
to
tyranny
Democracy
was
therefore
highly
fragile
and
rare
historically
as
it
could
only
survive
in
small
political
units
which
due
to
their
size
were
vulnerable
to
conquest
by
larger
political
units
Montesquieu
famously
said
if
republic
is
small
it
is
destroyed
by
outside
force
if
it
is
large
it
is
destroyed
by
internal
vice
Rousseau
asserted
It
is
therefore
natural
property
of
small
states
to
be
governed
as
republic
of
middling
ones
to
be
subject
to
monarch
and
of
large
empires
to
be
swayed
by
despotic
prince
Contemporary
theoryedit
Among
modern
political
theorists
there
are
three
contending
conceptions
of
democracy
aggregative
democracy
deliberative
democracy
and
radical
democracy
Aggregativeedit
The
theory
of
aggregative
democracy
claims
that
aim
of
democratic
processes
is
to
solicit
citizens
preferences
and
aggregate
them
together
to
determine
what
social
policies
society
should
adopt
Therefore
proponents
of
this
view
hold
that
democratic
participation
should
primarily
focus
on
voting
where
policy
with
most
votes
gets
implemented
Different
variants
of
aggregative
democracy
exist
Under
minimalism
democracy
is
system
of
government
in
which
citizens
have
given
teams
of
political
leaders
right
to
rule
in
periodic
elections
According
to
this
minimalist
conception
citizens
cannot
and
should
not
rule
because
for
example
on
most
issues
most
of
time
they
have
no
clear
views
or
their
views
are
not
wellfounded
Joseph
Schumpeter
articulated
this
view
most
famously
in
his
book
Capitalism
Socialism
and
Democracy
Contemporary
proponents
of
minimalism
include
William
H
Riker
Adam
Przeworski
Richard
Posner
According
to
theory
of
direct
democracy
on
other
hand
citizens
should
vote
directly
not
through
their
representatives
on
legislative
proposals
Proponents
of
direct
democracy
offer
varied
reasons
to
support
this
view
Political
activity
can
be
valuable
in
itself
it
socialises
and
educates
citizens
and
popular
participation
can
check
powerful
elites
Most
importantly
citizens
do
not
rule
themselves
unless
they
directly
decide
laws
and
policies
Governments
will
tend
to
produce
laws
and
policies
that
are
close
to
views
of
median
voterwith
half
to
their
left
and
other
half
to
their
right
This
is
not
desirable
outcome
as
it
represents
action
of
selfinterested
and
somewhat
unaccountable
political
elites
competing
for
votes
Anthony
Downs
suggests
that
ideological
political
parties
are
necessary
to
act
as
mediating
broker
between
individual
and
governments
Downs
laid
out
this
view
in
his
book
An
Economic
Theory
of
Democracy
Robert
A
Dahl
argues
that
fundamental
democratic
principle
is
that
when
it
comes
to
binding
collective
decisions
each
person
in
political
community
is
entitled
to
have
hisher
interests
be
given
equal
consideration
not
necessarily
that
all
people
are
equally
satisfied
by
collective
decision
He
uses
term
polyarchy
to
refer
to
societies
in
which
there
exists
certain
set
of
institutions
and
procedures
which
are
perceived
as
leading
to
such
democracy
First
and
foremost
among
these
institutions
is
regular
occurrence
of
free
and
open
elections
which
are
used
to
select
representatives
who
then
manage
all
or
most
of
public
policy
of
society
However
these
polyarchic
procedures
may
not
create
full
democracy
if
for
example
poverty
prevents
political
participation
Similarly
Ronald
Dworkin
argues
that
democracy
is
substantive
not
merely
procedural
ideal
Deliberativeedit
Deliberative
democracy
is
based
on
notion
that
democracy
is
government
by
deliberation
Unlike
aggregative
democracy
deliberative
democracy
holds
that
for
democratic
decision
to
be
legitimate
it
must
be
preceded
by
authentic
deliberation
not
merely
aggregation
of
preferences
that
occurs
in
voting
Authentic
deliberation
is
deliberation
among
decisionmakers
that
is
free
from
distortions
of
unequal
political
power
such
as
power
decisionmaker
obtained
through
economic
wealth
or
support
of
interest
groups
If
decisionmakers
cannot
reach
consensus
after
authentically
deliberating
on
proposal
then
they
vote
on
proposal
using
form
of
majority
rule
Citizens
assemblies
are
considered
by
many
scholars
as
practical
examples
of
deliberative
democracy
with
recent
OECD
report
identifying
citizens
assemblies
as
increasingly
popular
mechanism
to
involve
citizens
in
governmental
decisionmaking
Radicaledit
Radical
democracy
is
based
on
idea
that
there
are
hierarchical
and
oppressive
power
relations
that
exist
in
society
Democracys
role
is
to
make
visible
and
challenge
those
relations
by
allowing
for
difference
dissent
and
antagonisms
in
decisionmaking
processes

also
defend
that

does
not
depend
exclusively
on
performance
of
institutions
but
also
on
citizens
own
dispositions
and
commitment
Difficulties
in
measuring
democracyedit
Because
democracy
is
overarching
concept
that
includes
functioning
of
diverse
institutions
which
are
not
easy
to
measure
strong
limitations
exist
in
quantifying
and
econometrically
measuring
potential
effects
of
democracy
or
its
relationship
with
other
phenomenawhether
inequality
poverty
education
etc
Given
constraints
in
acquiring
reliable
data
with
withincountry
variation
on
aspects
of
democracy
academics
have
largely
studied
crosscountry
variations
Yet
variations
between
democratic
institutions
are
very
large
across
countries
which
constrains
meaningful
comparisons
using
statistical
approaches
Since
democracy
is
typically
measured
aggregately
as
macro
variable
using
single
observation
for
each
country
and
each
year
studying
democracy
faces
range
of
econometric
constraints
and
is
limited
to
basic
correlations
Crosscountry
comparison
of
composite
comprehensive
and
qualitative
concept
like
democracy
may
thus
not
always
be
for
many
purposes
methodologically
rigorous
or
useful

typically
Prime
Minister
will
hold
election
when
he
or
she
knows
that
they
are
in
good
favour
with
public
as
to
get
reelected
In
other
parliamentary
democracies
extra
elections
are
virtually
never
held
minority
government
being
preferred
until
next

elections
An
important
feature
of
parliamentary
democracy
is
concept
of
loyal
opposition
The
essence
of
concept
is
that
second
largest
political
party
or
coalition
opposes
governing
party
or
coalition
while
still
remaining
loyal
to
state
and
its
democratic
principles
Presidentialedit
Main
article
Presidential
system
Presidential
Democracy
is
system
where
public
elects
president
through
free
and
fair
elections
The
president
serves
as
both
head
of
state
and
head
of
government
controlling
most
of
executive
powers
The
president
serves
for
specific
term
and
cannot
exceed
that
amount
of
time
Elections
typically
have
fixed
date
and
arent
easily
changed
The
president
has
direct
control
over
cabinet
specifically
appointing
cabinet
members
The
president
cannot
be
easily
removed
from
office
by
legislature
but
he
or
she
cannot
remove
members
of
legislative
branch
any
more
easily
This
provides
some
measure
of
separation
of
powers
In
consequence
however
president
and
legislature
may
end
up
in
control
of
separate
parties
allowing
one
to
block
other
and
thereby
interfere
with
orderly
operation
of
state
This
may
be
reason
why
presidential
democracy
is
not
very
common
outside
Americas
Africa
and
Central
and
Southeast
Asia
A
semipresidential
system
is
system
of
democracy
in
which
government
includes
both
prime
minister
and
president
The
particular
powers
held
by
prime
minister
and
president
vary
by
country

Some
modern
democracies
that
are
predominantly
representative
in
nature
also
heavily
rely
upon
forms
of
political
action
that
are
directly
democratic
These
democracies
which
combine
elements
of
representative
democracy
and
direct
democracy
are
termed
hybrid
democracies
semidirect
democracies
or
participatory
democracies
Examples
include
Switzerland
and
some
US
states
where
frequent
use
is
made
of
referendums
and
initiatives
The
Swiss
confederation
is
semidirect
democracy
At
federal
level
citizens
can
propose
changes
to
constitution
federal
popular
initiative
or
ask
for
referendum
to
be
held
on
any
law
voted
by
parliament
Between
January
and
June
Swiss
citizens
voted
times
to
answer
questions
during
same
period
French
citizens
participated
in
only
two
referendums
Although
in
past
years
less
than
initiatives
have
been
put
to
referendum
The
populace
has
been
conservative
approving
only
about
of
initiatives
put
before
them
in
addition
they
have
often
opted
for
version
of
initiative
rewritten
by
governmentcitation
needed
Examples
include
extensive
use
of
referendums
in
US
state
of
California
which
is
state
that
has
more
than
million
voters
In
New
England
Town
meetings
are
often
used
especially
in
rural
areas
to
manage
local
government
This
creates
hybrid
form
of
government
with
local
direct
democracy
and
representative
state
government
For
example
most
Vermont
towns
hold
annual
town
meetings
in
March
in
which
town
officers
are
elected
budgets
for
town
and
schools
are
voted
on
and
citizens
have
opportunity
to
speak
and
be
heard
on
political
matters

Many

with

Republicedit
Main

Republicanism
The
term
republic
has
many
different
meanings
but
today
often
refers
to
representative
democracy
with
elected
head
of
state
such
as
president
serving
for
limited
term
in
contrast
to
states
with
hereditary
monarch
as
head
of
state
even
if
these
states
also
are
representative
democracies
with
elected
or
appointed
head
of
government
such
as
prime
minister
The
Founding
Fathers
of
United
States
rarely
praised
and
often
criticised
democracy
which
in
their
time
tended
to
specifically
mean
direct
democracy
often
without
protection
of
constitution
enshrining
basic
rights
James
Madison
argued
especially
in
The
Federalist
No
that
what
distinguished
direct
democracy
from
republic
was
that
former
became
weaker
as
it
got
larger
and
suffered
more
violently
from
effects
of
faction
whereas
republic
could
get
stronger
as
it
got
larger
and
combats
faction
by
its
very
structure
What
was
critical
to
American
values
John
Adams
insisted
was
that
government
be
bound
by
fixed
laws

people
have
voice

A

democracy
is
representative

is
subject
to
rule
of

and
moderated
by

In

it
is
possible
for
some
largescale
decisions
to
emerge
from
many
individual
decisions
that
citizens
are
free
to

In

Within
Marxist

there
is
hostility
to

which
is
simply
referred
to
as
parliamentary
democracy
because
of
its
often
centralised
nature
Because
of
orthodox

Anarchistedit
Anarchists
are
split
in
this
domain
depending
on
whether
they
believe
that
majorityrule
is
tyrannic
or
not
To
many
anarchists
only
form
of
democracy
considered
acceptable
is
direct
democracy
PierreJoseph
Proudhon
argued
that
only
acceptable
form
of
direct
democracy
is
one
in
which
it
is
recognised
that
majority
decisions
are
not
binding
on
minority
even
when
unanimous
However
anarchocommunist
Murray
Bookchin
criticised
individualist
anarchists
for
opposing
democracy
and
says
majority
rule
is
consistent
with
anarchism
Some
anarchocommunists
oppose
majoritarian
nature
of
direct
democracy
feeling
that
it
can
impede
individual
liberty
and
optin
favour
of
nonmajoritarian
form
of

to
Proudhons
position
on

Henry
David

who
did
not
selfidentify
as
anarchist
but
argued
for
better
government
and
is
cited
as
inspiration
by
some

argued
that

is
designed
by

This

allocates

heavily

Inclusive
democracy
Inclusive
democracy
is
political
theory
and
political
project
that
aims
for
direct
democracy
in
all
fields
of
social
life
political
democracy
in
form
of
facetoface
assemblies
which
are
confederated
economic
democracy
in
stateless
moneyless
and
marketless
economy
democracy
in
social
realm
ie
selfmanagement
in
places
of
work
and
education
and
ecological
democracy
which
aims
to
reintegrate
society
and
nature
The
theoretical
project
of
inclusive
democracy
emerged
from
work
of
political
philosopher
Takis
Fotopoulos
in
Towards
An
Inclusive
Democracy
and
was
further
developed
in
journal
Democracy
Nature
and
its
successor
The
International
Journal
of
Inclusive
Democracy
The
basic
unit
of
decision
making
in
inclusive
democracy
is
demotic
assembly
ie
assembly
of
demos
citizen
body
in
given
geographical
area
which
may
encompass
town
and
surrounding
villages
or
even
neighbourhoods
of
large
cities
An
inclusive
democracy
today
can
only
take
form
of
confederal
democracy
that
is
based
on
network
of
administrative
councils
whose
members
or
delegates
are
elected
from
popular
facetoface
democratic
assemblies
in
various
demoi
Thus
their
role
is
purely
administrative
and
practical
not
one
of
policymaking
like
that
of
representatives
in
representative
democracy
The
citizen
body
is
advised
by
experts
but
it
is
citizen
body
which
functions
as
ultimate
decisiontaker
Authority
can
be
delegated
to
segment
of
citizen
body
to
carry
out
specific
duties
for
example
to
serve
as
members
of
popular
courts
or
of
regional
and
confederal
councils
Such
delegation
is
made
in
principle
by
lot
on
rotation
basis
and
is
always
recallable
by
citizen
body
Delegates
to
regional
and
confederal
bodies
should
have
specific
mandates

Participatory
politics
A
Parpolity
or
Participatory
Polity
is
theoretical
form
of
democracy
that
is
ruled
by
Nested
Council
structure
The
guiding
philosophy
is
that
people
should
have
decision
making
power
in
proportion
to
how
much
they
are
affected
by
decision
Local
councils
of
people
are
completely
autonomous
on
issues
that
affect
only
them
and
these
councils
send
delegates
to
higher
level
councils
who
are
again
autonomous
regarding
issues
that
affect
only
population
affected
by
that
council
A
council
court
of
randomly
chosen
citizens
serves
as
check
on
tyranny
of
majority
and
rules
on
which
body
gets
to
vote
on
which
issue
Delegates
may
vote
differently
from
how
their
sending
council
might
wish
but
are
mandated
to
communicate
wishes
of
their
sending
council
Delegates
are
recallable
at
any
time
Referendums
are
possible
at
any
time
via
votes
of
most
lowerlevel
councils
however
not
everything
is
referendum
as
this
is
most
likely
waste
of
time
A
parpolity
is
meant
to
work
in

with

Cosmopolitanedit
Main

Cosmopolitan
democracy
Cosmopolitan
democracy
also
known
as
Global
democracy
or
World
Federalism
is
political
system
in
which
democracy
is
implemented
on
global
scale
either
directly
or
through
representatives
An
important
justification
for
this
kind
of
system
is
that
decisions
made
in
national
or
regional
democracies
often
affect
people
outside
constituency
who
by
definition
cannot
vote
By
contrast
in
cosmopolitan
democracy
people
who
are
affected
by
decisions
also
have
say
in
them
According
to
its
supporters
any
attempt
to
solve
global
problems
is
undemocratic
without
some
form
of
cosmopolitan
democracy
The
general
principle
of
cosmopolitan
democracy
is
to
expand
some
or
all
of
values
and
norms
of
democracy
including
rule
of
law
nonviolent
resolution
of
conflicts
and
equality
among
citizens
beyond
limits
of
state
To
be
fully
implemented
this
would
require
reforming
existing
international
organisations
eg
United
Nations
as
well
as
creation
of
new
institutions
such
as
World
Parliament
which
ideally
would
enhance
public
control
over
and
accountability
in
international
politics
Cosmopolitan
Democracy
has
been
promoted
among
others
by
physicist
Albert
Einstein
writer
Kurt
Vonnegut
columnist
George
Monbiot
and
professors
David
Held
and
Daniele
Archibugi
The
creation
of

as
major
step

by
many
supporters
of
this

Creative

Creative
democracy
Creative
Democracy
is
advocated
by
American
philosopher
John
Dewey
The
main
idea
about
Creative
Democracy
is
that
democracy
encourages
individual
capacity
building
and
interaction
among
society
Dewey
argues
that
democracy
is
way
of

his
work

The
Task
Before
Us
and
experience
built
on
faith
in
human
nature
faith
in
human
beings
and
faith
in
working
with
others
Democracy
in
Deweys
view
is
moral
ideal
requiring
actual
effort
and
work
by
people
it
is
not
institutional
concept
that
exists
outside
of
ourselves
The
task
of
democracy
Dewey
concludes
is
forever
that
of
creation
of
freer
and
more
humane
experience
in
which
all
share
and
to
which
all
contribute

Several
justifications
for
democracy
have
been
postulated
Legitimacyedit
Social
contract
theory
argues
that
legitimacy
of
government
is
based
on
consent
of
governed
ie
election
and
that
political
decisions
must
reflect
general
will
Better

theorem
is
logical
proof
that
if
each
decisionmaker
has
better
than
chance
probability
of
making
right
decision
then
having
largest
number
of
decisionmakers
ie
democracy
will
result
in
best
decisions
This
has
also
been
argued
by
theories
of
wisdom
of
crowd

Economic

In
Why
Nations

Daron
Acemoglu
and
James
A
Robinson
argue
that
democracies
are
more
economically
successful
because
undemocratic
political
systems
tend
to
limit
markets
and
favor
monopolies
at
expense
of
creative
destruction
which
is
necessary
for
sustained
economic
growth

Arrows
formal
premises

be
considered

strict

critical
Inefficienciesedit
Some
economists
have
criticized
efficiency
of
democracy
citing
premise
of
irrational
voter
or
voter
who
makes
decisions
without
all
of
facts
or
necessary
information
in
order
to
make
truly
informed
decision
Another
argument
is
that
democracy
slows
down
processes
because
of
amount
of
input
and
participation
needed
in
order
to
go
forward
with
decision
A
common
example
often
quoted
to
substantiate
this
point
is
high
economic
development
achieved
by
China
nondemocratic
country
as
compared
to
India
democratic
country
According
to
economists
lack
of
democratic
participation
in
countries
like
China
allows
for
unfettered
economic
growth
On
other
hand
Socrates
believed
that
democracy
without
educated
masses
educated
in
broader
sense
of
being
knowledgeable
and
responsible
would
only
lead
to
populism
being
criteria
to
become
elected
leader
and
not
competence
This
would
ultimately
lead
to
demise
of
nation
This
was
quoted
by
Plato
in
book
of
The
Republic
in
Socrates
conversation
with
Adimantus
Socrates
was
of
opinion
that
right
to
vote
must
not
be
indiscriminate
right
for
example
by
birth
or
citizenship
but
must
be
given
only
to
people
who
thought
sufficiently
of
their
choice
Popular
rule
as
faadeedit
The
thcentury
Italian
thinkers
Vilfredo
Pareto
and
Gaetano
Mosca
independently
argued
that
democracy
was
illusory
and
served
only
to
mask
reality
of
elite
rule
Indeed
they
argued
that
elite
oligarchy
is
unbendable
law
of
human
nature
due
largely
to
apathy
and
division
of
masses
as
opposed
to
drive
initiative
and
unity
of
elites
and
that
democratic
institutions
would
do
no
more
than
shift
exercise
of
power
from
oppression
to
manipulation
As
Louis
Brandeis
once
professed
We
may
have
democracy
or
we
may
have
wealth
concentrated
in
hands
of
few
but
we
cant

Mob
ruleedit
Platos
The
Republic
presents
critical
view
of
democracy
through
narration
of
Socrates
Democracy
which
is
charming
form
of
government
full
of
variety
and
disorder
and
dispensing
sort
of
equality
to
equals
and
unequaled
alike
In
his
work
Plato
lists
forms
of
government
from
best
to
worst
Assuming
that
Republic
was
intended
to
be
serious
critique
of
political
thought
in
Athens
Plato
argues
that
only
Kallipolis
aristocracy
led
by
unwilling
philosopherkings
wisest
men
is
just
form
of
government
James
Madison
critiqued
direct
democracy
which
he
referred
to
simply
as
democracy
in
Federalist
No
arguing
that
representative
democracywhich
he
described
using
term
republicis
preferable
form
of
government
saying
democracies
have
ever
been
spectacles
of
turbulence
and
contention
have
ever
been
found
incompatible
with
personal
security
or
rights
of
property
and
have
in
general
been
as
short
in
their
lives
as
they
have
been
violent
in
their
deaths
Madison
offered
that
republics
were
superior
to
democracies
because
republics
safeguarded
against
tyranny
of
majority
stating
in
Federalist
No
same
advantage
which
republic
has
over
democracy
in
controlling
effects
of
faction
is
enjoyed
by
large
over
small
republic
Political
instabilityedit
More
recently
democracy
is
criticised
for
not
offering
enough
political
stability
As
governments
are
frequently
elected
on
and
off
there
tends
to
be
frequent
changes
in
policies
of
democratic
countries
both
domestically
and
internationally
Even
if
political
party
maintains
power
vociferous
headlinegrabbing
protests
and
harsh
criticism
from
popular
media
are
often
enough
to
force
sudden
unexpected
political
change
Frequent
policy
changes
with
regard
to
business
and
immigration
are
likely
to
deter
investment
and
so
hinder
economic
growth
For
this
reason
many
people
have
put
forward
idea
that
democracy
is
undesirable
for
developing
country
in
which
economic
growth
and
reduction
of
poverty
are
top
priorities
This
opportunist
alliance
not
only
has
handicap
of
having
to
cater
to
too
many
ideologically
opposing
factions
but
it
is
usually
shortlived
since
any
perceived
or
actual
imbalance
in
treatment
of
coalition
partners
or
changes
to
leadership
in
coalition
partners
themselves
can
very
easily
result
in
coalition
partner
withdrawing
its
support
from
government
Biased
media
has
been
accused
of
causing
political
instability
resulting
in
obstruction
of
democracy
rather
than
its
promotion
Fraudulent
electionsedit
In
representative
democracies
it
may
not
benefit
incumbents
to
conduct
fair
elections
A
study
showed
that
incumbents
who
rig
elections
stay
in
office
times
as
long
as
those
who
permit
fair
elections
Democracies
in
countries
with
high
per
capita
income
have
been
found
to
be
less
prone
to
violence
but
in
countries
with
low
incomes
tendency
is
reverse
Election
misconduct
is
more
likely
in
countries
with
low
per
capita
incomes
small
populations
rich
in
natural
resources
and
lack
of
institutional
checks
and
balances
SubSaharan
countries
as
well
as
Afghanistan
all
tend
to
fall
into
that
category
Governments
that
have
frequent
elections
tend
to
have
significantly
more
stable
economic
policies
than
those
governments
who
have
infrequent
elections
However
this
trend
does
not
apply
to
governments
where
fraudulent
elections
are
common
Oppositionedit
Main

Antidemocratic

Democracy
in
modern
times
has
almost
always
faced
opposition
from
previously
existing
government
and
many
times
it
has
faced
opposition
from

elites
The
implementation

August
Several
philosophers
and
researchers
have
outlined
historical
and
social
factors
seen
as
supporting
evolution
of
democracy
Other
commentators
have
mentioned
influence
of
economic
development
In
related
theory
Ronald
Inglehart
suggests
that
improved
livingstandards
in
modern
developed
countries
can
convince
people
that
they
can
take
their
basic
survival
for
granted
leading
to
increased
emphasis
on
selfexpression
values
which
correlates
closely
with
democracy
Douglas
M
Gibler
and
Andrew
Owsiak
in
their
study
argued
about
importance
of
peace
and
stable
borders
for
development
of
democracy
It
has
often
been
assumed
that
democracy
causes
peace
but
this
study
shows
that
historically
peace
has
almost
always
predated
establishment
of
democracy
Carroll
Quigley
concludes
that
characteristics
of
weapons
are
main
predictor
of
democracy
Democracythis
scenariotends
to
emerge
only
when
best
weapons
available
are
easy
for
individuals
to
obtain
and
use
By
s
guns
were
best
personal
weapons
available
and
in
United
States
of
America
already
nominally
democratic
almost
everyone
could
afford
to
buy
gun
and
could
learn
how
to
use
it
fairly
easily
Governments
couldnt
do
any
better
it
became
age
of
mass
armies
of
citizen
soldiers
with
guns
Similarly
Periclean
Greece
was
age
of
citizen
soldier
and
democracy
Other
theories
stressed
relevance
of
education
and
of
human
capitaland
within
them
of
cognitive
ability
to
increasing
tolerance
rationality
political
literacy
and

Evidence
consistent
with
conventional
theories
of
why
democracy
emerges
and
is
sustained
has
been
hard
to
come
by
Statistical
analyses
have
challenged
modernisation
theory
by
demonstrating
that
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
for
claim
that
democracy
is
more
likely
to
emerge
when
countries
become
wealthier
more
educated
or
less
unequal
Neither
is
there
convincing
evidence
that
increased
reliance
on
oil
revenues
prevents
democratisation
despite
vast
theoretical
literature
on
Resource
Curse
that
asserts
that
oil
revenues
sever
link
between
citizen
taxation
and
government
accountability
seen
as
key
to
representative
democracy
The
lack
of
evidence
for
these
conventional
theories
of
democratisation
have
led
researchers
to
search
for
deep
determinants
of
contemporary
political
institutions
be
they
geographical
or
demographic
More
inclusive
institutions
lead
to
democracy
because
as
people
gain
more
power
they
are
able
to
demand
more
from
elites
who
in
turn
have
to
concede
more
things
to
keep
their
positioncitation
needed
This
virtuous
circle
may
end
up
in
democracy
An
example
of
this
is
disease
environment
Places
with
different
mortality
rates
had
different
populations
and
productivity
levels
around
world
For
example
in
Africa
tsetse
flywhich
afflicts
humans
and
livestockreduced
ability
of
Africans
to
plow
land
This
made
Africa
less
settled
As
consequence
political
power
was
less
concentrated
This
also
affected
colonial
institutions
European
countries
established
in
Africa
Whether
colonial
settlers
could
live
or
not
in
place
made
them
develop
different
institutions
which
led
to
different
economic
and
social
paths
This
also
affected
distribution
of
power
and
collective
actions
people
could
take
As
result
some
African
countries
ended
up
having
democracies
and
others
autocracies
An
example
of
geographical
determinants
for
democracy
is
having
access
to
coastal
areas
and
rivers
This
natural
endowment
has
positive
relation
with
economic
development
thanks
to
benefits
of
trade
Trade
brought
economic
development
which
in
turn
broadened
power
Rulers
wanting
to
increase
revenues
had
to
protect
propertyrights
to
create
incentives
for
people
to
invest
As
more
people
had
more
power
more
concessions
had
to
be
made
by
ruler
and
in
manyquantify
places
this
process
lead
to
democracy
These
determinants
defined
structure
of
society
moving
balance
of
political
power
In
st
century
democracy
has
become
such
popular
method
of
reaching
decisions
that
its
application
beyond
politics
to
other
areas
such
as
entertainment
food
and
fashion
consumerism
urban
planning
education
art
literature
science
and
theology
has
been
criticised
as
reigning
dogma
of
our
time
The
argument
suggests
that
applying
populist
or
marketdriven
approach
to
art
and
literature
for
example
means
that
innovative
creative
work
goes
unpublished
or
unproduced
In
education
argument
is
that
essential
but
more
difficult
studies
are
not
undertaken
Science
as
truthbased
discipline
is
particularly
corrupted
by
idea
that
correct
conclusion
can
be
arrived
at
by
popular
vote
However
more
recently
theoristswhich
have
also
advanced
concept
epistemic
democracy
to
assert
that
democracy
actually
does
good
job
tracking
truth
Robert
Michels
asserts
that
although
democracy
can
never
be
fully
realised
democracy
may
be
developed
automatically
in
act
of
striving
for
democracy
The
peasant
in
fable
when
on
his
deathbed
tells
his
sons
that
treasure
is
buried
in
field
After
old
mans
death
sons
dig
everywhere
in
order
to
discover
treasure
They
do
not
find
it
But
their
indefatigable
labor
improves
soil
and
secures
for
them
comparative
wellbeing
The
treasure
in
fable
may
well
symbolise
democracy
Dr
Harald
Wydra
in
his
book
Communism
and
The
Emergence
of
Democracy
maintains
that
development
of
democracy
should
not
be
viewed
as
purely
procedural
or
as
static
concept
but
rather
as
ongoing
process
of
meaning
formation
Drawing
on
Claude
Leforts
idea
of
empty
place
of
power
that
power
emanates
from
people
but
is
power
of
nobody
he
remarks
that
democracy
is
reverence
to
symbolic
mythical
authorityas
in
reality
there
is
no
such
thing
as
people
or
demos
Democratic
political
figures
are
not
supreme
rulers
but
rather
temporary
guardians
of
empty
place
Any
claim
to
substance
such
as
collective
good
public
interest
or
will
of
nation
is
subject
to
competitive
struggle
and
times
of
forclarification
needed
gaining
authority
of
office
and
government
The
essence
of
democratic
system
is
empty
place
void
of
real
people
which
can
only
be
temporarily
filled
and
never
be
appropriated
The
seat
of
power
is
there
but
remains
open
to
constant
change

The
earliest
and
perhaps
greatest
victory
for
liberalism
was
achieved
in
England
The
rising
commercial
class
that
had
supported
Tudor
monarchy
in
th
century
led
revolutionary
battle
in
th
and
succeeded
in
establishing
supremacy
of
Parliament
and
eventually
of
House
of
Commons
What
emerged
as
distinctive
feature
of
modern
constitutionalism
was
not
insistence
on
idea
that
king
is
subject
to
law
although
this
concept
is
essential
attribute
of
all
constitutionalism
This
notion
was
already
well
established
in
Middle
Ages
What
was
distinctive
was
establishment
of
effective
means
of
political
control
whereby
rule
of
law
might
be
enforced
Modern
constitutionalism
was
born
with
political
requirement
that
representative
government
depended
upon
consent
of
citizen
subjects
However
as
can
be
seen
through
provisions
in
Bill
of
Rights
English
Revolution
was
fought
not
just
to
protect
rights
of
property
in
narrow
sense
but
to
establish
those
liberties
which
liberals
believed
essential
to
human
dignity
and
moral
worth
The
rights
of
man
enumerated
in
English
Bill
of
Rights
gradually
were
proclaimed
beyond
boundaries
of
England
notably
in
American
Declaration
of

in

Democracy
rule
of

and

liberty
Intelligence
doijintell
Political
theory
has
described
positive
linkage
between
education
cognitive
ability
and
democracy
This
assumption
is
confirmed
by
positive
correlations
between
education
cognitive
ability
and
positively
valued
political
conditions
N
It
is
shown
that
in
second
half
of
th
century
education
and
intelligence
had
strong
positive
impact
on
democracy
rule
of
law
and
political
liberty
independent
from
wealth
GDP
and
chosen
country
sample
One
possible
mediator
of
these
relationships
is
attainment
of
higher
stages
of
moral
judgment
fostered
by
cognitive
ability
which
is
necessary
for
function
of
democratic
rules
in
society
The
other
mediators
for
citizens
as
well
as
for
leaders
could
be
increased
competence
and
willingness
to
process
and
seek
information
necessary
for
political
decisions
due
to
greater
cognitive
ability
There
are
also
weaker
and
less
stable
reverse
effects
of
rule
of
law
and
political
freedom
on
cognitive
ability

A
dictatorship
is
form
of
government
characterized
by
single
leader
or
group
of
leaders
and
little
or
no
toleration
for
political
pluralism
or
independent
media
According
to
other
definitions
democracies
are
form
of
government
in
which
those
who
govern
are
selected
through
contested
elections
therefore
dictatorships
are
not
democracies
With
advent
of
th
and
th
centuries
dictatorships
and
constitutional
democracies
emerged
as
worlds
two
major
forms
of
government
gradually
eliminating
monarchies
one
of
traditional
widespread
forms
of
government
of
time
Typically
in
dictatorial
regime
leader
of
country
is
identified
with
title
of
dictator
although
their
formal
title
may
more
closely
resemble
something
similar
to
leader
A
common
aspect
that
characterized
dictatorship
is
taking
advantage
of
their
strong
personality
usually
by
suppressing
freedom
of
thought
and
speech
of
masses
in
order
to
maintain
complete
political
and
social
supremacy
and
stability
Dictatorships
and
totalitarian
societies
generally
employ
political
propaganda
to
decrease
influence
of
proponents
of
alternative
governing
systems

Roman

The
word

comes
from
Latin
language
word
dicttor
agent
noun
from
dictare
dictt
past
participial
stem
of
dictre
dictate
v
or
or

In
Latin
use
dictator
was
judge
in
Roman
Republic
temporarily
invested
with
absolute
power
Typesedit
A
dictatorship
has
been
largely
defined
as
form
of
government
in
which
absolute
power
is
concentrated
in
hands
of
leader
commonly
identified
as
dictator
small
clique
or
government
organization
and
it
aims
to
abolish
political
pluralism
and
civilian
mobilization
On
other
hand
democracy
which
is
generally
compared
to
concept
of
dictatorship
is
defined
as
form
of
government
in
which
power
belongs
to
population
and
rulers
are
elected
through
contested
elections
A
newer
form
of
government
originating
around
early
th
century
commonly
linked
to
concept
of
dictatorship
is
known
as
totalitarianism
It
is
characterized
by
presence
of
single
political
party
and
more
specifically
by
powerful
leader
real
role
model
who
imposes
his
personal
and
political
prominence
The
two
fundamental
aspects
that
contribute
to
maintenance
of
power
are
steadfast
collaboration
between
government
and
police
force
and
highly
developed
ideology
The
government
has
total
control
of
mass
communications
and
social
and
economic
organizations
According
to
Hannah
Arendt
totalitarianism
is
new
and
extreme
form
of
dictatorship
composed
of
atomized
isolated
individuals
In
addition
she
affirmed
that
ideology
plays
leading
role
in
defining
how
entire
society
should
be
organized
According
to
political
scientist
Juan
Linz
distinction
between
authoritarian
regime
and
totalitarian
one
is
that
while
authoritarian
regime
seeks
suffocate
politics
and
political
mobilization
but
totalitarianism
seeks
to
control
politics
and
political
mobilization
However
one
of
most
recent
classification
of
dictatorships
does
not
identify
totalitarianism
as
form
of
dictatorship
Barbara
Geddess
study
focuses
in
how
eliteleader
and
elitemass
relations
influence
authoritarian
politics
Her
typology
identifies
key
institutions
that
structure
elite
politics
in
dictatorships
ie
parties
and
militaries
The
study
is
based
on
and
directly
related
to
some
factors
like
simplicity
of
categorizations
crossnational
applicability
emphasis
on
elites
and
leaders
and
incorporation
of
institutions
parties
and
militaries
as
central
to
shaping
politics
According
to
her
dictatorial
government
may
be
classified
in
five
typologies
military
dictatorships
singleparty
dictatorships
personalist
dictatorships
monarchies
and
hybrid
dictatorships

Military
dictatorship
Military
dictatorships
are
regimes
in
which
group
of
officers
holds
power
determines
who
will
lead
country
and
exercises
influence
over
policy
Highlevel
elites
and
leader
are
members
of
military
dictatorship
Military
dictatorships
are
characterized
by
rule
by
professionalized
military
as
institution
In
military
regimes
elites
are
referred
to
as
junta
members
who
are
typically
senior
officers
and
often
other
highlevel
officers
in
military
This
type
of
dictatorship
was
imposed
during
th
century
in
countries
such
as
Chile
by
Augusto

Singleparty
dictatorships
are
regimes
in
which
one
party
dominates
politics
In
singleparty
dictatorships
single
party
has
access
to
political
posts
and
control
over
policy
In
singleparty
dictatorships
party
elites
are
typically
members
of
ruling
body
of
party
sometimes
called
central
committee
politburo
or
secretariat
Those
groups
of
individuals
controls
selection
of
party
officials
and
organizes
distribution
of
benefits
to
supporters
and
mobilizes
citizens
to
vote
and
show
support
for
party
leaders
Current
oneparty
states
include
China
Cuba
Eritrea
Laos
North
Korea
and
Vietnam
though
North
Korea
is
sometimes
also
classified
as
personalist
dictatorship
The
Sahrawi
Arab
Democratic
Republic
which
is
not
recognized
by
UN
is
also
oneparty
state
but
is
not
considered
to
be
dictatorship
Personalist
dictatorshipsedit
Personalist
dictatorships
are
regimes
in
which
all
power
lies
in
hands
of
single
individual
Personalist
dictatorships
differ
from
other
forms
of
dictatorships
in
their
access
to
key
political
positions
other
fruits
of
office
and
depend
much
more
on
discretion
of
personalist
dictator
Personalist
dictators
may
be
members
of
military
or
leaders
of
political
party
However
neither
military
nor
party
exercises
power
independently
from
dictator
In
personalist
dictatorships
elite
corps
are
usually
made
up
of
close
friends
or
family
members
of
dictator
These
individuals
are
all
typically
handpicked
to
serve
their
posts
by
dictator
According
to
study
personalist
dictatorships
are
more
repressive
than
other
forms
of
dictatorship

dictatorships
are
in
regimes
in
which

in

but
absolute
monarchies
such

Real

to
be
classified
as
such
Elites

Hybrid

Hybrid
dictatorships
are
regimes
that
blend
qualities
of
personalist

and
military

When

share
characteristics
of

three
forms
of

they
are
referred

Empire
ruled
since
AD
until
AD
Roman
dictators
were
allocated
absolute
power
during
times
of
emergency
In
execution
their
power
was
originally
neither
arbitrary
nor
unaccountable
being
subject
to
law
and
requiring
retrospective
justification
There
were
no
such
dictatorships
after
beginning
of
nd
century
BC
and
later
dictators
such
as
Sulla
and
Roman
emperors
exercised
power
much

of
rationales
that

employed
periodically
during
runup
to
invasion
of
Iraq
is
that
deposing

Hussein

installing
democratic
government
in
Iraq
would
promote
democracy
in
other
Middle
Eastern
countries
However
according
to
The

The

territories
with
little
or
no
democratic
rule
represent
more
than
half
of

Dictatorship
of
proletariat
Mancur
Olson
suggests
that
emergence
of
dictatorships
can
be
linked
to
concept
of
roving
bandits
individuals
in
atomic
system
who
move
from
place
to
place
extracting
wealth
from
individuals
These
bandits
provide
disincentive
for
investment
and
production
Olson
states
that
community
of
individuals
would
be
served
less
badly
if
that
bandit
were
to
establish
himself
as
stationary
bandit
to
monopolize
theft
in
form
of
taxes
Except
from
community
bandits
themselves
will
be
better
served
according
to
Olson
by
transforming
themselves
into
stationary
bandits
By
settling
down
and
making
themselves
rulers
of
territory
they
will
be
able
to
make
more
profits
through
taxes
than
they
used
to
obtain
through
plunder
By
maintaining
order
and
providing
unsollicited
protection
to
community
bandits
will
create
environment
in
which
people
can
increase
their
surplus
which
means
greater
taxable
base
Thus
potential
dictator
will
have
greater
incentive
to
provide
illusion
of
security
to
given
community
from
which
he
is
extracting
taxes
and
conversely
unthinking
part
of
people
from
whom
he
extracts
taxes
are
more
likely
to
produce
because
they
will
be
unconcerned
with
potential
theft
by
other
bandits
This
is
rational
that
bandits
use
in
order
to
explain
their
transformation
from
roving
bandits
into
stationary
bandits

A
directorial
republic
is
country
ruled
by
college
of
several
people
who
jointly
exercise
powers
of
head
of
state
andor
head
of
government
In
political
history
term
directory
in
French
directoire
is
applied
to
high
collegial
institutions
of
state
composed
of
members
styled
director
The
most
important
of
these
by
far
was
Directory
of
in
France
The
system
was
inspired
by
Pennsylvania
Constitution
of
which
prominently
featured
collegial
member
Supreme
Executive
Council
with
primus
inter
pares
President
Variants
of
this
form
of
government
based
on
French
model
were
also
established
in
European
regions
conquered
by
France
during
French
Revolutionary
Wars
In
past
Uruguay
Yugoslavia
after
Ukraine
and
other
countries
were
ruled
by
directories
The
government
of
Soviet
Union
could
in
some
ways
be
characterized
as
directory
but
it
developed
in
much
different
pattern
discussed
in
article
on
Communist
states
The
sole
country
now
using
this
form
of
government
is
Switzerland
and
to
lesser
extent
San
Marino
where
directories
rule
all
levels
of
administration
federal
cantonal
and
municipal
The
Swiss
Federal
Council
is
elected
by
Parliament
for
four
years
its
members
cannot
be
dismissed
and
is
composed
of
seven
members
among
whom
one
is
president
and
one
is
vicepresident
on
rotating
basis
although
these
positions
are
symbolic
in
normal
circumstances
There
is
no
relationship
of
confidence
between
Parliament
and
Federal
Council
It
is
shared
system
of
government
that
reflects
and
represents
heterogeneity
and
multiethnicity
of
Swiss
people
Direct
popular
elections
are
used
at
local
level

A
federacy
is
form
of
government
with
features
of
both
federation
and
unitary
state
In
federacy
at
least
one
of
constituent
parts
of
state
is
autonomous
while
other
constituent
parts
are
either
not
autonomous
or
comparatively
less
autonomous

example
of

Kashmir

After

princely
states
of
British
India

given
choice
to
opt
for
either
India
or
Pakistan
The
Kashmir
state
was
ruled
by
Hindu
king
Maharaja
Hari
Singh
but
majority
of
its
population
was
Muslim
According
to
Burton
Steins
History
of
India
Kashmir
was
neither
as
large
nor
as
old
independent
state
as
Hyderabad
it
had
been
created
rather
offhandedly
by
British
after
first
defeat
of
Sikhs

as
reward
to
former
official
who
had
sided
with
British
The
Himalayan
kingdom
was
connected
to
India
through
district
of
Punjab
but
its
population
was
per
cent
Muslim
and
it
shared
boundary
with
Pakistan
Hence
it
was
anticipated
that
maharaja
would
accede
to
Pakistan

to
do
this
Pathan
tribesman
launched

accede

Main

Asymmetric

In

political
deference
to

independent
language
and

policies
Some
unitary
states

also
be
regarded
as
asymmetric

For

etc

greater
autonomy
and
political
deference
than

of

autonomous
communities

of

The
difference
between
asymmetric
federation
and
federacy
is
indistinct
federacy

essentially
extreme

due

Criticismsedit
Jaime
Lluch
has
critiqued
classification
and
description
of
federacy
as
used
by
Elazar
and
Watts
Lluch
argues
that
category
of
federacy
is
misapplied
to
case
of
Puerto
Rico
and
to
other
comparable
cases
and
that
it
is
example
of
conceptual
stretching
He
finds
that
federacies
is
in
end
not
helpful
category
to
understanding
types
of
institutional
arrangements
referred
and
recommends
that
scholars
of
comparative
federalism
need
to
find
more
nuanced
category
to
describe
contemporary
actuallyexisting
autonomies
such
as
Puerto
Rico
Lluch
shows
that
federacies
have
little
to
do
with
federalism
and
are
in
fact
distinct
status
arrangements
that
are
more
properly
seen
as
autonomies
of
which
there
is
wide
variety
This
variety
includes
autonomies
which
are
classified
along
continuum
that
would
take
several
federacies
and
reclassify
them
thus

The
case
of
Puerto
Ricoedit
In
examining
Puerto
Rico
case
Lluch
notes
that
although
Elazar
has
mischaracterized
nature
of
Puerto
RicoUSA
relationship
it
is
still
cited
as
prototype
of
federacy
Lluch
defines
Puerto
Rico
as
nonfederal
autonomy
which
is
officially
unincorporated
territory
belonging
to
federal
political
system
that
is
USA
and
subject
to
plenary
powers
of
US
Congress
under
Territorial
Clause
of
US
Constitution
and
states
that
it
is
not
freeassociated
state
Similar
conclusions
were
made
by
three
Presidential
Task
Forces
on
Puerto
Ricos
Status
in
and
In
particular
Lluch
notes
that
contrary
to
Elazars
assertions
in
his
and
works
power
to
terminate
or
modify
Puerto
RicoUSA
relationship
rests
squarely
on
US
Congress
and
that
US
government
contends
that
sovereignty
over
Puerto
Rico
resides
solely
in
United
States
and
not
in
people
of
Puerto
Rico
Lluch
notes
that
both
Watts
and
Elazar
define
federacy
as
political
arrangements
where
large
unit
is
linked
to
smaller
unit
or
units
but
smaller
unit
retains
considerable
autonomy
and
has
minimum
role
in
government
of
larger
one
and
where
relationship
can
be
dissolved
only
by
mutual
agreement
However
contrary
to
this
definition
he
notes
that
far
from
having
minimum
role
in
government
of
United
States
Puerto
Rico
has
no
effective
representation
in
Congress
except
for
token
representative
that
has
no
right
to
vote
there
Nor
do
residents
of
Puerto
Rico
vote
for
US
President
However
Puerto
Ricans
are
eligible
to
join
US
political
parties
and
both
major
parties
conduct
primary
elections
for
national
positions
in
Puerto
Rico
Puerto
Rico
thus
has
no
direct
representation
in
institutions
of
central
state
He
notes
that
essentially
Puerto
RicoUSA
relationship
exhibits
some
elements
of
empire
and
nearly
none
of
federalism
Puerto
Rico
is
better
conceptualized
as
exemplar
of
autonomism
with
category
of
federacy
being
less
helpful
to
explain
it

Definitionedit
There
is
no
commonly
accepted
modern
definition
of
feudalism
at
least
among
scholars
The
adjective
feudal
was
in
use
by
at
least
and
noun
feudalism
now
often
employed
in
political
and
propagandistic
context
was
coined
by
paralleling
French
fodalit
feudality
According
to
classic
definition
by
FranoisLouis
Ganshof
feudalism
describes
set
of
reciprocal
legal
and
military
obligations
which
existed
among
warrior
nobility
and
revolved
around
three
key
concepts
of
lords
vassals
and
fiefs
though
Ganshof
himself
noted
that
his
treatment
was
only
related
to
narrow
technical
legal
sense
of
word
A
broader
definition
as
described
in
Marc
Blochs
Feudal
Society
includes
not
only
obligations
of
warrior
nobility
but
obligations
of
all
three
estates
of
realm
nobility
clergy
and
those
who
lived
off
their
labor
most
directly
peasantry
which
was
bound
by
system
of
manorialism
this
order
is
often
referred
to
as
feudal
society
echoing
Blochs
usage
Outside
its
European
context
concept
of
feudalism
is
often
used
by
analogy
most
often
in
discussions
of
feudal
Japan
under
shoguns
and
sometimes
in
discussions
of
Zagwe
dynasty
in
medieval
Ethiopia
which
had
some
feudal
characteristics
sometimes
called
semifeudal
Some
have
taken
feudalism
analogy
further
seeing
feudalism
or
traces
of
it
in
places
as
diverse
as
China
during
Spring
and
Autumn
period
BCE
ancient
Egypt
Parthian
Empire
Indian
subcontinent
and
Antebellum
and
Jim
Crow
American
South
The
term
feudalism
has
also
been
appliedoften
inappropriately
or
pejorativelyto
nonWestern
societies
where
institutions
and
attitudes
which
are
similar
to
those
which
existed
in
medieval
Europe
are
perceived
to
prevail
Some
historians
and
political
theorists
believe
that
term
feudalism
has
been
deprived
of
specific
meaning
by
many
ways
it
has
been
used
leading
them
to
reject
it
as
useful
concept
for
understanding
society
Etymologyedit
Herr
Reinmar
von
Zweter
thcentury
Minnesinger
was
depicted
with
his
noble
arms
in
Codex
Manesse
The
root
of
term
feudal
originates
in
Aryan
word
peku
meaning
cattle
and
possessed
cognates
in
many
other
IndoEuropean
languages

The
term
fodal
was
first
used
in
thcentury
French
legal
treatises
and
translated
into
English
legal
treatises
as
adjective
such
as
feodal
government
In
th
century
Adam
Smith
seeking
to
describe
economic
systems
effectively
coined
forms
feudal
government
and
feudal
system
in
his
book
Wealth
of
Nations
The
phrase
feudal
system
appeared
in
in
Baronia
Anglica
published
nine
years
after
death
of
its
author
Thomas
Madox
in
In
in
his
History
of
Manchester
John
Whitaker
first
introduced
word
feudalism
and
notion
of
feudal
pyramid
The
term
feudal
or
feodal
is
derived
from
medieval
Latin
word
feodum
The
etymology
of
feodum
is
complex
with
multiple
theories
some
suggesting
Germanic
origin
most
widely
held
view
and
others
suggesting
Arabic
origin
Initially
in
medieval
Latin
European
documents
land
grant
in
exchange
for
service
was
called
beneficium
Latin
Later
term
feudum
or
feodum
began
to
replace
beneficium
in
documents
The
first
attested
instance
of
this
is
from
although
more
primitive
forms
were
seen
up
to
onehundred
years
earlier
The
origin
of
feudum
and
why
it
replaced
beneficium
has
not
been
well
established
but
there
are
multiple
theories
described
below
The
most
widely
held
theory
was
proposed
by
Johan
Hendrik
Caspar
Kern
in
being
supported
by
amongst
others
William
Stubbs
and
Marc
Bloch
Kern
derived
word
from
putative
Frankish
term
fehud
in
which
fehu
means
cattle
and
d
means
goods
implying
moveable
object
of
value
Bloch
explains
that
by
beginning
of
th
century
it
was
common
to
value
land
in
monetary
terms
but
to
pay
for
it
with
moveable
objects
of
equivalent
value
such
as
arms
clothing
horses
or
food
This
was
known
as
feos
term
that
took
on
general
meaning
of
paying
for
something
in
lieu
of
money
This
meaning
was
then
applied
to
land
itself
in
which
land
was
used
to
pay
for
fealty
such
as
to
vassal
Thus
old
word
feos
meaning
movable
property
changed
little
by
little
to
feus
meaning
exact
opposite
landed
property
It
has
also
been
suggested
that
word
comes
from
Gothic
faihu
meaning
property
specificallycattle
Another
theory
was
put
forward
by
Archibald
R
Lewis
Lewis
said
origin
of
fief
is
not
feudum
or
feodum
but
rather
foderum
earliest
attested
use
being
in
Astronomuss
Vita
Hludovici
In
that
text
is
passage
about
Louis
Pious
that
says
annona
militaris
quas
vulgo
foderum
vocant
which
can
be
translated
as
Louis
forbade
that
military
provender
which
they
popularly
call
fodder
be
furnished
Another
theory
by
Alauddin
Samarrai
suggests
Arabic
origin
from
fuy
plural
of
fay
which
literally
means
returned
and
was
used
especially
for
land
that
has
been
conquered
from
enemies
that
did
not
fight
Samarrais
theory
is
that
early
forms
of
fief
include
feo
feu
feuz
feuum
and
others
plurality
of
forms
strongly
suggesting
origins
from
loanword
The
first
use
of
these
terms
is
in
Languedoc
one
of
least
Germanic
areas
of
Europe
and
bordering
Muslim
Spain
Further
earliest
use
of
feuum
as
replacement
for
beneficium
can
be
dated
to
same
year
Muslim
base
at
Fraxinetum
La
GardeFreinet
in
Provence
was
established
It
is
possible
Samarrai
says
that
French
scribes
writing
in
Latin
attempted
to
transliterate
Arabic
word
fuy
plural
of
fay
which
was
being
used
by
Muslim
invaders
and
occupiers
at
time
resulting
in
plurality
of
forms
feo
feu
feuz
feuum
and
others
from
which
eventually
feudum
derived
Samarrai
however
also
advises
to
handle
this
theory
with
care
as
Medieval
and
Early
Modern
Muslim
scribes
often
used
etymologically
fanciful
roots
in
order
to
claim
most
outlandish
things
to
be
of
Arabian
or
Muslim
origin
Historyedit
Feudalism
in
its
various
forms
usually
emerged
as
result
of
decentralization
of
empire
especially
in
Carolingian
Empire
in
th
century
AD
which
lacked
bureaucratic
infrastructureclarification
needed
necessary
to
support
cavalry
without
allocating
land
to
these
mounted
troops
Mounted
soldiers
began
to
secure
system
of
hereditary
rule
over
their
allocated
land
and
their
power
over
territory
came
to
encompass
social
political
judicial
and
economic
spheres
These
acquired
powers
significantly
diminished
unitary
power
in
these
empires
However
once
infrastructure
to
maintain
unitary
power
was
reestablishedas
with
European
monarchiesfeudalism
began
to
yield
to
this
new
power
structure
and
eventually
disappeared

The
classic
FranoisLouis
Ganshof
version
of
feudalism
describes
set
of
reciprocal
legal
and
military
obligations
which
existed
among
warrior
nobility
revolving
around
three
key
concepts
of
lords
vassals
and
fiefs
In
broad
terms
lord
was
noble
who
held
land
vassal
was
person
who
was
granted
possession
of
land
by
lord
and
land
was
known
as
fief
In
exchange
for
use
of
fief
and
protection
by
lord
vassal
would
provide
some
sort
of
service
to
lord
There
were
many
varieties
of
feudal
land
tenure
consisting
of
military
and
nonmilitary
service
The
obligations
and
corresponding
rights
between
lord
and
vassal
concerning
fief
form
basis
of
feudal
relationship
Vassalageedit
Homage
of
ClermontenBeauvaisis
Before
lord
could
grant
land
fief
to
someone
he
had
to
make
that
person
vassal
This
was
done
at
formal
and
symbolic
ceremony
called
commendation
ceremony
which
was
composed
of
twopart
act
of
homage
and
oath
of
fealty
During
homage
lord
and
vassal
entered
into
contract
in
which
vassal
promised
to
fight
for
lord
at
his
command
whilst
lord
agreed
to
protect
vassal
from
external
forces
Fealty
comes
from
Latin
fidelitas
and
denotes
fidelity
owed
by
vassal
to
his
feudal
lord
Fealty
also
refers
to
oath
that
more
explicitly
reinforces
commitments
of
vassal
made
during
homage
Such
oath
follows

Once

complete
lord
and
vassal
were
in
feudal
relationship
with
agreed
obligations
to
one
another
The
vassals
principal
obligation
to
lord
was
to
aid
or
military
service
Using
whatever
equipment
vassal
could
obtain
by
virtue
of
revenues
from
fief
vassal
was
responsible
to
answer
calls
to
military
service
on
behalf
of
lord
This
security
of
military
help
was
primary
reason
lord
entered
into
feudal
relationship
In
addition
vassal
could
have
other
obligations
to
his
lord
such
as
attendance
at
his
court

or
at

It
could
also
involve
vassal
providing
counsel
so
that
if
lord
faced
major
decision
he
would
summon
all
his
vassals
and
hold
council
At
level
of
manor
this
might
be
fairly
mundane
matter
of
agricultural
policy
but
also
included
sentencing
by
lord
for
criminal
offences
including
capital
punishment
in
some
cases
Concerning

feudal

such
deliberation
could
include

In
its
origin

grant
of

had
been

terms
of

between
lord
and

with

and

holdings

came
to
be
seen
as

expression
used
by
historian
Marc
Bloch
The
th
century
in
France
saw
what
has
been
called
by
historians
feudal
revolution
or
mutation
and
fragmentation
of
powers
Bloch
that
was
unlike
development
of
feudalism
in
England
or
Italy
or
Germany
in
same
period
or
later
Counties
and
duchies
began
to
break
down
into
smaller
holdings
as
castellans
and
lesser
seigneurs
took
control
of
local
lands
and
as

what
Georges
Duby
called
collectively

Power
in
this
period
became
more
personal
This
fragmentation
of
powers
was
not
however
systematic
throughout
France
and
in
certain
counties
such
as
Flanders
Normandy
Anjou
Toulouse
counts
were
able
to
maintain
control
of
their
lands
into
th
century
or
later
Thus
in
some
regions
like
Normandy
and
Flanders
vassalfeudal
system
was
effective
tool
for
ducal
and
comital
control
linking
vassals
to
their
lords
but
in
other
regions
system
led
to
significant
confusion
all
more
so
as
vassals
could
and
frequently
did
pledge
themselves
to
two
or
more
lords
In
response
to
this
idea
of
liege
lord
was
developed
where
obligations
to
one
lord
are
regarded
as
superior
in
th

explains
how

on
just
one
night
of

France
abolished

remnants
of

Lefebvre
explains
Without

Assembly
enthusiastically
adopted
equality
of
taxation
and
redemption
of
all
manorial
rights
except
for
those
involving
personal
servitudewhich
were
to

freedom

prohibition
of

Privileges
of
provinces
and
towns
were
offered
as
last
sacrifice
Originally
peasants
were
supposed
to
pay
for
release
of
seigneurial
dues
these
dues
affected
more
than
quarter
of
farmland
in
France
and
provided
most
of
income
of
large
landowners
The
majority
refused
to
pay
and
in
obligation
was
cancelled
Thus
peasants
got
their
land
free
and
also
no
longer
paid
tithe

The
concept
of
feudal
state
or
period
in
sense
of
either
regime
or
period
dominated
by
lords
who
possess
financial
or
social
power
and
prestige
became
widely
held
in
middle
of
th
century
as
result
of
works
such
as
Montesquieus
De
LEsprit
des
Lois
published
in
English
as
The
Spirit
of

and

In
th
century
writers
of
Enlightenment
wrote
about
feudalism
to
denigrate
antiquated
system
of
Ancien
Rgime
or
French
monarchy
This
was
Age
of
Enlightenment
when
writers
valued
reason
and
Middle
Ages
were
viewed
as
Dark
Ages
Enlightenment
authors
generally
mocked
and
ridiculed
anything
from
Dark
Ages
including
feudalism
projecting
its
negative
characteristics
on
current
French
monarchy
as
means
of
political
gain
For
them
feudalism
meant
seigneurial
privileges
and
prerogatives
When
French
Constituent
Assembly
abolished
feudal
regime
in
August
this
is
what
was
meant
Adam
Smith
used
term
feudal
system
to
describe
social
and
economic
system
defined
by
inherited
social
ranks
each
of
which
possessed
inherent
social
and
economic
privileges
and
obligations
In
such
system
wealth
derived
from
agriculture
which
was
arranged
not
according
to
market
forces
but
on
basis
of
customary
labour
services
owed
by
serfs
to
landowning
nobles
Karl
Marxedit
Karl
Marx
also
used
term
in
th
century
in
his
analysis
of
societys
economic
and
political
development
describing
feudalism
or
more
usually
feudal
society
or
feudal
mode
of
production
as
order
coming
before
capitalism
For
Marx
what
defined
feudalism
was
power
of
ruling
class
aristocracy
in
their
control
of
arable
land
leading
to
class
society
based
upon
exploitation
of
peasants
who
farm
these
lands
typically
under
serfdom
and
principally
by
means
of
labour
produce
and
money
rents
Marx
thus
defined
feudalism
primarily
by
its
economic
characteristics
He
also
took
it
as
paradigm
for
understanding
powerrelationships
between
capitalists
and
wagelabourers
in
his
own
time
in
precapitalist
systems
it
was
obvious
that
most
people
did
not
control
their
own
destinyunder
feudalism
for
instance
serfs
had
to
work
for
their
lords
Capitalism
seems
different
because
people
are
in
theory
free
to
work
for
themselves
or
for
others
as
they
choose
Yet
most
workers
have
as
little
control
over
their
lives
as
feudal
serfs
Some
later
Marxist
theorists
eg
Eric
Wolf
have
applied
this
label
to
include
nonEuropean
societies
grouping
feudalism
together
with
Imperial
Chinese
and
preColumbian
Incan
societies

In
late
th
and
early
th
centuries
John
Horace
Round
and
Frederic
William
Maitland
both
historians
of
medieval
Britain
arrived
at
different
conclusions
as
to
character
of
English
society
before
Norman
Conquest
in
Round
argued
that
Normans
had
brought
feudalism
with
them
to
England
while
Maitland
contended
that
its
fundamentals
were
already
in
place
in
Britain
before
The
debate
continues
today
but
consensus
viewpoint
is
that
England
before
Conquest
had
commendation
which
embodied
some
of
personal
elements
in
feudalism
while
William
Conqueror
introduced
modified
and
stricter
northern
French
feudalism
to
England
incorporating
oaths
of
loyalty
to
king
by
all
who
held
by
feudal
tenure
even
vassals
of
his
principal
vassals
holding
by
feudal
tenure
meant
that
vassals
must
provide
quota
of
knights
required
by
king
or
money
payment
in
substitution
In
th
century
two
outstanding
historians
offered
still
more
widely
differing
perspectives
The
French
historian
Marc
Bloch
arguably
most
influential
thcentury
medieval
historian
approached
feudalism
not
so
much
from
legal
and
military
point
of
view
but
from
sociological
one
presenting
in
Feudal
Society
English
feudal
order
not
limited
solely
to
nobility
It
is
his
radical
notion
that
peasants
were
part
of
feudal
relationship
that
sets
Bloch
apart
from
his
peers
while
vassal
performed
military
service
in
exchange
for
fief
peasant
performed
physical
labour
in
return
for
protection
both
are
form
of
feudal
relationship
According
to
Bloch
other
elements
of
society
can
be
seen
in
feudal
terms
all
aspects
of
life
were
centered
on
lordship
and
so
we
can
speak
usefully
of
feudal
church
structure
feudal
courtly
and
anticourtly
literature
and
feudal
economy
In
contradistinction
to
Bloch
Belgian
historian
FranoisLouis
Ganshof
defined
feudalism
from
narrow
legal
and
military
perspective
arguing
that
feudal
relationships
existed
only
within
medieval
nobility
itself
Ganshof
articulated
this
concept
in
Questce
que
la
fodalit
What
is
feudalism
translated
in
English
as
Feudalism
His
classic
definition
of
feudalism
is
widely
accepted
today
among
medieval
scholars
though
questioned
both
by
those
who
view
concept
in
wider
terms
and
by
those
who
find
insufficient
uniformity
in
noble
exchanges
to
support
such
model
Although
he
was
never
formally
student
in
circle
of
scholars
around
Marc
Bloch
and
Lucien
Febvre
that
came
to
be
known
as
Annales
School
Georges
Duby
was
exponent
of

tradition

sources
surviving
from

of
Cluny
as
well
as
dioceses
of
Mcon
and
Dijon
Duby
excavated
complex
social
and
economic
relationships
among
individuals
and
institutions
of
Mconnais
region
and
charted
profound
shift
in
social
structures
of
medieval
society
around
year
He
argued
that
in
early
th
century
governing
institutionsparticularly
comital
courts
established
under
Carolingian
monarchythat
had
represented
public
justice
and
order
in
Burgundy
during
th
and
th
centuries
receded
and
gave
way
to
new
feudal
order
wherein
independent
aristocratic
knights
wielded
power
over
peasant
communities
through
strongarm
tactics
and
threats
of
violence
In
Austrian
historian
Theodor
Mayer
de
subordinated
feudal
state
as
secondary
to
his
concept
of
Personenverbandsstaat
personal
interdependency
state
understanding
it
in
contrast
to
territorial
state
This
form
of
statehood
identified
with
Holy
Roman
Empire
is
described
as
most
complete
form
of
medieval
rule
completing
conventional
feudal
structure
of
lordship
and
vassalage
with
personal
association
between
nobility
But
applicability
of
this
concept
to
cases
outside
of
Holy
Roman
Empire
has
been
questioned
as
by
Susan
Reynolds
The
concept
has
also
been
questioned
and
superseded
in
German
histography
because
of
its
bias
and
reductionism
towards
legitimating
Fhrerprinzip
Challenges
to

modeledit
In
American
historian
Elizabeth
A
R
Brown
rejected
label
feudalism
as
anachronism
that
imparts
false
sense
of
uniformity
to
concept
Having
noted
current
use
of
many
often
contradictory
definitions
of
feudalism
she
argued
that
word
is
only
construct
with
no
basis
in
medieval
reality
invention
of
modern
historians
read
back
tyrannically
into
historical
record
Supporters
of
Brown
have
suggested
that
term
should
be
expunged
from
history
textbooks
and
lectures
on
medieval
history
entirely
In

Susan
Reynolds
expanded
upon
Browns
original
thesis
Although
some
contemporaries
questioned
Reynoldss
methodology
other
historians
have
supported
it
and
her
argument
Reynolds
argues
Too
many
models
of
feudalism
used
for
comparisons
even
by
Marxists
are
still
either
constructed
on
thcentury
basis
or
incorporate
what
in
Marxist
view
must
surely
be
superficial
or
irrelevant
features
from
it
Even
when
one
restricts
oneself
to
Europe
and
to
feudalism
in
its
narrow
sense
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
feudovassalic
institutions
formed
coherent
bundle
of
institutions
or
concepts
that
were
structurally
separate
from
other
institutions
and
concepts
of
time
The
term
feudal
has
also
been
applied
to
nonWestern
societies
in
which
institutions
and
attitudes
similar
to
those
of
medieval
Europe
are
perceived
to
have
prevailed
See
Examples
of
feudalism
Japan
has
been
extensively
studied
in
this
regard
Friday
notes
that
in
st
century
historians
of
Japan
rarely
invoke
feudalism
instead
of
looking
at
similarities
specialists
attempting
comparative
analysis
concentrate
on
fundamental
differences
Ultimately
critics
say
many
ways
term
feudalism
has
been
used
have
deprived
it
of
specific
meaning
leading
some
historians
and
political
theorists
to
reject
it
as
useful
concept
for
understanding
society

Definitionsedit
Early
definitionsedit
The
most
common
definition
of
meritocracy
conceptualizes
merit
in
terms
of
tested
competency
and
ability
and
most
likely
as
measured
by
IQ
or
standardized
achievement
tests
In
government
and
other
administrative
systems
meritocracy
refers
to
system
under
which
advancement
within
system
turns
on
merits
like
performance
intelligence
credentials
and
education
These
are
often
determined
through
evaluations
or
examinationspage
needed
In
more
general
sense
meritocracy
can
refer
to
any
form
of
evaluation
based
on
achievement
Like
utilitarian
and
pragmatic
word
meritocratic
has
also
developed
broader
connotation
and
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
any
government
run
by
ruling
or
influential
class
of
educated
or
able
people
This
is
in
contrast
to
original
condemnatory
use
of
term
in
by
Michael
Dunlop
Young
in
his
work
The
Rise
of
Meritocracy
who
was
satirizing
ostensibly
meritbased
Tripartite
System
of
education
practiced
in
United
Kingdom
at
time
he
claimed
that
in
Tripartite
System
merit
is
equated
with
intelligencepluseffort
its
possessors
are
identified
at
early
age
and
selected
for
appropriate
intensive
education
and
there
is
obsession
with
quantification
testscoring
and
qualifications
Meritocracy
in
its
wider
sense
may
be
any
general
act
of
judgment
upon
basis
of
various
demonstrated
merits
such
acts
frequently
are
described
in
sociology
and
psychology
In
rhetoric
demonstration
of
ones
merit
regarding
mastery
of
particular
subject
is
essential
task
most
directly
related
to
Aristotelian
term
Ethos
The
equivalent
Aristotelian
conception
of
meritocracy
is
based
upon
aristocratic
or
oligarchic
structures
rather
than
in
context
of
modern
state
More
recent
definitionsedit
In
United
States
assassination
of
President
James
A
Garfield
in
prompted
replacement
of
American
Spoils
System
with
meritocracy
In
The
Pendleton
Civil
Service
Reform
Act
was
passed
stipulating
government
jobs
should
be
awarded
on
basis
of
merit
through
competitive
exams
rather
than
ties
to
politicians
or
political
affiliation
The
most
common
form
of
meritocratic
screening
found
today
is
college
degree
Higher
education
is
imperfect
meritocratic
screening
system
for
various
reasons
such
as
lack
of
uniform
standards
worldwide
lack
of
scope
not
all
occupations
and
processes
are
included
and
lack
of
access
some
talented
people
never
have
opportunity
to
participate
because
of
expense
most
especially
in
developing
countries
Nonetheless
academic
degrees
serve
some
amount
of
meritocratic
screening
purpose
in
absence
of
more
refined
methodology
Education
alone
however
does
not
constitute
complete
system
as
meritocracy
must
automatically
confer
power
and
authority
which
degree
does
not
accomplish
independentlycitation

Etymologyedit
Although
concept
has
existed
for
centuries
term
meritocracy
is
relatively
new
It
was
used
pejoratively
by
British
politician
and
sociologist
Michael
Dunlop
Young
in
his
satirical
essay
The
Rise
of
Meritocracy
which
pictured
United
Kingdom
under
rule
of
government
favouring
intelligence
and
aptitude
merit
above
all
else
being
combination
of
root
of
Latin
origin
merit
from
mere
meaning
earn
and
Ancient
Greek
suffix
cracy
meaning
power
rule
The
purely
Greek
word
is
axiocracy
from
axios
worthy
cracy
power
In
this
book
term
had
distinctly
negative
connotations
as
Young
questioned
both
legitimacy
of
selection
process
used
to
become
member
of
this
elite
and
outcomes
of
being
ruled
by
such
narrowly
defined
group
The
essay
written
in
first
person
by
fictional
historical
narrator
in
interweaves
history
from
politics
of
pre
and
postwar
Britain
with
those
of
fictional
future
events
in
short
onward
and
long
term
onward
The
essay
was
based
upon
tendency
of
thencurrent
governments
in
their
striving
toward
intelligence
to
ignore
shortcomings
and
upon
failure
of
education
systems
to
utilize
correctly
gifted
and
talented
members
within
their
societies
Youngs
fictional
narrator
explains
that
on
one
hand
greatest
contributor
to
society
is
not
stolid
mass
or
majority
but
creative
minority
or
members
of
restless
elite
On
other
hand
he
claims
that
there
are
casualties
of
progress
whose
influence
is
underestimated
and
that
from
such
stolid
adherence
to
natural
science
and
intelligence
arises
arrogance
and
complacency
This
problem
is
encapsulated
in
phrase
Every
selection
of
one
is
rejection
of
many
It
was
also
used
by
Hannah
Arendt
in
her
essay
Crisis
in
Education
which
was
written
in
and
refers

According
to
scholarly
consensus
earliest
example
of
administrative
meritocracy
based
on
civil
service
examinations
dates
back
to
Ancient
China
The
concept
originates
at
least
by
sixth
century
BC
when
it
was
advocated
by
Chinese
philosopher
Confucius
who
invented
notion
that
those
who
govern
should
do
so
because
of
merit
not
of
inherited
status
This
sets
in
motion
creation
of
imperial
examinations
and
bureaucracies
open
only
to
those
who
passed
tests
As
Qin
and
Han
dynasties
developed
meritocratic
system
in
order
to
maintain
power
over
large
sprawling
empire
it
became
necessary
for
government
to
maintain
complex
network
of
officials
Prospective
officials
could
come
from
rural
background
and
government
positions
were
not
restricted
to
nobility
Rank
was
determined
by
merit
through
civil
service
examinations
and
education
became
key
for
social
mobility
After
fall
of
Han
Dynasty
ninerank
system
was
established
during
Three
Kingdoms
period
According
to
Princeton
Encyclopedia
of
American
History
One
of
oldest
examples
of
meritbased
civil
service
system
existed
in
imperial
bureaucracy
of
China
Tracing
back
to
BC
Han
Dynasty
adopted
Confucianism
as
basis
of
its
political
philosophy
and
structure
which
included
revolutionary
idea
of
replacing
nobility
of
blood
with
one
of
virtue
and
honesty
and
thereby
calling
for
administrative
appointments
to
be
based
solely
on
merit
This
system
allowed
anyone
who
passed
examination
to
become
government
officer
position
that
would
bring
wealth
and
honor
to
whole
family

Meadows
successfully
argued
in
his
Desultory
Notes
on
Government
and
People
of
China
published
in
that
long
duration
of
Chinese
empire
is
solely
and
altogether
owing
to
good
government
which
consists
in
advancement
of
men
of
talent
and
merit
only
and
that
British
must
reform
their
civil
service
by
making
institution
meritocratic
This
practice
later
was
adopted
in
late
nineteenth
century
by
British
mainland
inspired
by
Chinese
mandarin
system
The
British
philosopher
and
polymath
John
Stuart
Mill
advocated
meritocracy
in
his
book
Considerations
on
Representative
Government
His
model
was
to
give
more
votes
to
more
educated
voter
His
views
are
explained
in
Estlund
Mills
proposal
of
plural
voting
has
two
motives
One
is
to
prevent
one
group
or
class
of
people
from
being
able
to
control
political
process
even
without
having
to
give
reasons
in
order
to
gain
sufficient
support
He
calls
this
problem
of
class
legislation
Since
most
numerous
class
is
also
at
lower
level
of
education
and
social
rank
this
could
be
partly
remedied
by
giving
those
at
higher
ranks
plural
votes
A
second
and
equally
prominent
motive
for
plural
voting
is
to
avoid
giving
equal
influence
to
each
person
without
regard
to
their
merit
intelligence
etc
He
thinks
that
it
is
fundamentally
important
that
political
institutions
embody
in
their
spirit
recognition
that
some
opinions
are
worth
more
than
others
He
does
not
say
that
this
is
route
to
producing
better
political
decisions
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
his
argument
based
on
this
second
motive
in
any
other
way
So
if
Aristotle
is
right
that
deliberation
is
best
if
participants
are
numerous
and
assuming
for
simplicity
that
voters
are
deliberators
then
this
is
reason
for
giving
all
or
many
citizens
vote
but
this
does
not
yet
show
that
wiser
subset
should
not
have
say
two
or
three
in
that
way
something
would
be
given
both
to
value
of
diverse
perspectives
and
to
value
of
greater
wisdom
of
few
This
combination
of
Platonic
and
Aristotelian
points
is
part
of
what
I
think
is
so
formidable
about
Mills
proposal
of
plural
voting
It
is
also
advantage
of
his
view
that
he
proposes
to
privilege
not
wise
but
educated
Even
if
we
agreed
that
wise
should
rule
there
is
serious
problem
about
how
to
identify
them
This
becomes
especially
important
if
successful
political
justification
must
be
generally
acceptable
to
ruled
In
that
case
privileging
wise
would
require
not
only
their
being
so
wise
as
to
be
better
rulers
but
also
and
more
demandingly
that
their
wisdom
be
something
that
can
be
agreed
to
by
all
reasonable
citizens
I
turn
to
this
conception
of
justification
below
Mills
position
has
great
plausibility
good
education
promotes
ability
of
citizens
to
rule
more
wisely
So
how
can
we
deny
that
educated
subset
would
rule
more
wisely
than
others
But
then
why
shouldnt
they
have
more
votes

Singapore
describes
meritocracy
as
one
of
its
official
guiding
principles
for
domestic
public
policy
formulation
placing
emphasis
on
academic
credentials
as
objective
measures
of
merit
There
is
criticism
that
under
this
system
Singaporean
society
is
being
increasingly
stratified
and
that
elite
class
is
being
created
from
narrow
segment
of
population
Singapore
has
growing
level
of
tutoring
for
children
and
top
tutors
are
often
paid
better
than
school
teachers
Defenders
of
this
system
recall
ancient
Chinese
proverb
Wealth
does
not
pass
beyond
three
generations
Chinese
suggesting
that
nepotism
or
cronyism
of
elitists
eventually
will
be
and
often
are
replaced
by
those
lower
down
hierarchy
Singaporean
academics
are
continuously
reexamining
application
of
meritocracy
as
ideological
tool
and
how
its
stretched
to
encompass
ruling
partys
objectives
Professor
Kenneth
Paul
Tan
at
Lee
Kuan
Yew
School
of
Public
Policy
asserts
that
Meritocracy
in
trying
to
isolate
merit
by
treating
people
with
fundamentally
unequal
backgrounds
as
superficially
same
can
be
practice
that
ignores
and
even
conceals
real
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
are
unevenly
distributed
to
different
segments
of
inherently
unequal
society
practice
that
in
fact
perpetuates
this
fundamental
inequality
In
this
way
those
who
are
picked
by
meritocracy
as
having
merit
may
already
have
enjoyed
unfair
advantages
from
very
beginning
ignored
according
to
principle
of
nondiscrimination
How
meritocracy
in
Singaporean
context
relates
to
application
of
pragmatism
as
ideological
device
which
combines
strict
adherence
to
market
principles
without
any
aversion
to
social
engineering
and
little
propensity
for
classical
social
welfarism
is
further
illustrated
by
Kenneth
Paul
Tan
in
subsequent
articles
There
is
strong
ideological
quality
in
Singapores
pragmatism
and
strongly
pragmatic
quality
in
ideological
negotiations
within
dynamics
of
hegemony
In
this
complex
relationship
combination
of
ideological
and
pragmatic
maneuvering
over
decades
has
resulted
in
historical
dominance

Myth
of
meritocracy
and
Justworld
hypothesis
The
term
meritocracy
was
originally
intended
as
negative
concept
One
of
primary
concerns
with
meritocracy
is
unclear
definition
of
merit
What
is
considered
as
meritorious
can
differ
with
opinions
as
on
which
qualities
are
considered
most
worthy
raising
question
of
which
merit
is
highestor
in
other
words
which
standard
is
best
standard
As
supposed
effectiveness
of
meritocracy
is
based
on
supposed
competence
of
its
officials
this
standard
of
merit
cannot
be
arbitrary
and
has
to
also
reflect
competencies
required
for
their
roles
The
reliability
of
authority
and
system
that
assesses
each
individuals
merit
is
another
point
of
concern
As
meritocratic
system
relies
on
standard
of
merit
to
measure
and
compare
people
against
system
by
which
this
is
done
has
to
be
reliable
to
ensure
that
their
assessed
merit
accurately
reflects
their
potential
capabilities
Standardized
testing
which
reflects
meritocratic
sorting
process
has
come
under
criticism
for
being
rigid
and
unable
to
accurately
assess
many
valuable
qualities
and
potentials
of
students
Education
theorist
Bill
Ayers
commenting
on
limitations
of
standardized
testing
writes
that
Standardized
tests
cant
measure
initiative
creativity
imagination
conceptual
thinking
curiosity
effort
irony
judgment
commitment
nuance
good
will
ethical
reflection
or
host
of
other
valuable
dispositions
and
attributes
What
they
can
measure
and
count
are
isolated
skills
specific
facts
and
function
content
knowledge
least
interesting
and
least
significant
aspects
of
learning
Merit
determined
through
opinionated
evaluations
of
teachers
while
being
able
to
assess
valuable
qualities
that
cannot
be
assessed
by
standardized
testing
are
unreliable
as
opinions
insights
biases
and
standards
of
teachers
vary
greatly
If
system
of
evaluation
is
corrupt
nontransparent
opinionated
or
misguided
decisions
regarding
who
has
highest
merit
can
be
highly
fallible
The
level
of
education
required
in
order
to
become
competitive
in
meritocracy
may
also
be
costly
effectively
limiting
candidacy
for
position
of
power
to
those
with
means
necessary
to
become
educated
An
example
of
this
was
Chinese
student
selfdeclared
messiah
Hong
Xiuquan
who
despite
ranking
first
in
preliminary
nationwide
imperial
examination
was
unable
to
afford
further
education
As
such
although
he
did
try
to
study
in
private
Hong
was
ultimately
noncompetitive
in
later
examinations
and
unable
to
become
bureaucrat
This
economic
aspect
of
meritocracies
has
been
said
to
continue
nowadays
in
countries
without
free
educations
with
Supreme
Court
of
United
States
for
example
consisting
only
of
justices
who
attended
Harvard
or
Yale
and
generally
only
considering
clerkship
candidates
who
attended
topfive
university
while
in
s
two
universities
only
accounted
for
around
one
fifth
of
justices
Even
if
free
education
were
provided
resources
that
parents
of
student
are
able
to
provide
outside
of
curriculum
such
as
tutoring
exam
preparation
and
financial
support
for
living
costs
during
higher
education
will
influence
education
student
attains
and
students
social
position
in
meritocratic
society
This
limits
fairness
and
justness
of
any
meritocratic
system
Similarly
feminist
critics
have
noted
that
many
hierarchical
organisations
actually
favour
individuals
who
have
received
disproportionate
support
of
informal
kind
eg
mentorship
wordofmouth
opportunities
and
so
on
such
that
only
those
who
benefit
from
such
supports
are
likely
to
understand
these
organisations
as
meritocratic
Another
concern
regards
principle
of
incompetence
or
Peter
Principle
As
people
rise
in
meritocratic
society
through
social
hierarchy
through
their
demonstrated
merit
they
eventually
reach
and
become
stuck
at
level
too
difficult
for
them
to
perform
effectively
they
are
promoted
to
incompetence
This
reduces
effectiveness
of
meritocratic
system
supposed
main
practical
benefit
of
which
is
competence
of
those
who
run
society
In
his
book
Meritocratic
Education
and
Social
Worthlessness
Palgrave
philosopher
Khen
Lampert
argued
that
educational
meritocracy
is
nothing
but
postmodern
version
of
Social
Darwinism
Its
proponents
argue
that
theory
justifies
social
inequality
as
being
meritocratic
This
social
theory
holds
that
Darwins
theory
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
is
model
not
only
for
development
of
biological
traits
in
population
but
also
as
application
for
human
social
institutions
existing
social
institutions
being
implicitly
declared
as
normative
Social
Darwinism
shares
its
roots
with
early
progressivism
and
was
most
popular
from
late
nineteenth
century
to
end
of
World
War
II
Darwin
only
ventured
to
propound
his
theories
in
biological
sense
and
it
is
other
thinkers
and
theorists
who
have
applied
Darwins
model
normatively
to
unequal
endowments
of
human
ambitions
Harvard
philosopher
Michael
Sandel
in
his
latest
book
makes
case
against
meritocracy
calling
it
tyranny
Ongoing
stalled
social
mobility
and
increasing
inequality
are
laying
bare
crass
delusion
of
American
Dream
and
promise
you
can
make
it
if
you
want
and
try
The
latter
according
to
Sandel
is
main
culprit
of
anger
and
frustration
which
brought
some
Western
countries
towards
populism

Notesedit
This
is
history
of
meritocracy
in
technical
sense
The
vaguer
definition
of
meritocracy
as
rule
by
intelligence
has
been
applied
to
many
ancient
Greek
Indian
Chinese
and
Jewish
thinkers
and
statesmen
For
example
Sanhedrin
legislature
of
Ancient
Israel
and
Kingdom
of
Judah
is
sometimes
called
as
intellectual
meritocracy
in
sense
that
its
members
were
drawn
from
religious
scribes
and
not
aristocracy
Appointment
was
selfperpetuating
however
and
new
members
were
chosen
personally
by
existing
members
These
are
not
meritocracies
in
administrative
sense
in
which
merit
is
determined
objectively
as
tested
competency
or
ability

from

chronicle
A
monarchy
is
form
of
government
in
which
person
monarch
is
head
of
state
for
life
or
until
abdication
The
political
legitimacy
and
authority
of
monarch
may
vary
from
purely
symbolic
crowned
republic
to
restricted
constitutional
monarchy
to
fully
autocratic
absolute
monarchy
and
can
expand
across
domains
of
executive
legislative
and
judicial
A
monarchy
can
be
polity
through
unity
personal
union
vassalage
or
federation
and
monarchs
can
carry
various
titles
such
as
emperor
king
queen
raja
khan
caliph
tsar
sultan
shah
or
pharaoh
In
most
cases
succession
of
monarchies
is
hereditary
often
building
dynastic
periods
however
elective
and
selfproclaimed
monarchies
are
possible
Aristocrats
though
not
inherent
to
monarchies
often
serve
as
pool
of
persons
to
draw
monarch
from
and
fill
constituting
institutions
eg
diet
and
court
giving
many
monarchies
oligarchic
elements
Monarchies
were
most
common
form
of
government
until
th
century
Today
fortyfive
sovereign
nations
in
world
have
monarch
including
sixteen
Commonwealth
realms
that
have
Elizabeth
II
as
head
of
state
Other
than
that
there
are
range
of
subnational
monarchical
entities
Modern
monarchies
tend
to
be
constitutional
monarchies
retaining
under
constitution
unique
legal
and
ceremonial
roles
for
monarch
exercising
limited
or
no
political
power
similar
to
heads
of
state
in
parliamentary
republic
The
opposing
and
alternative
form
of
government
to
monarchy
has
become
republic

The
similar
form
of
societal
hierarchy
known
as
chiefdom
or
tribal
kingship
is
prehistoric
Chiefdoms
provided
concept
of
state
formation
which
started
with
civilizations
such
as
Mesopotamia
Ancient
Egypt
and
Indus
Valley
Civilization
In
some
parts
of
world
chiefdoms
became
monarchies
Some
of
oldest
recorded
and
evidenced
monarchies
were
Narmer
Pharaoh
of
Ancient
Egypt
c
BCE
and
Enmebaragesi
Sumerian
King
of
Kish
c
BCE
From
earliest
historical
times
with
Egyptian
Mesopotamian
Sudanic
reconstructed
ProtoIndoEuropean
religion
and
others
king
held
sacral
functions
directly
connected
to
sacrifice
or
was
considered
by
their
people
to
have
divine
ancestry
In
Germanic
antiquity
kingship
was
primarily
sacral
function
The
king
was
directly
hereditary
for
some
tribes
while
for
others
he
was
elected
from
among
eligible
members
of
royal
families
by
thing
The
role
of
Roman
emperor
as
protector
of
Christianity
led
eventually
to
monarchs
ruling
by
Grace
of
God
in
Christian
Middle
Ages
only

basic

The

classical
antiquity
is
often
identified
as
king
or
ruler
translating
archon
basileus
rex
tyrannos
etc
or
as
queen

Polybius
originally
understood
monarchynote
as
component
of
republics

since
antiquity
monarchy
has
contrasted
with
forms
of
republic
where
executive
power
is
wielded
by
free
citizens
and
their
assemblies

By
th
century
monarchy
was
challenged
by
evolving
parliamentarism
eg
through
regional
assemblies
such
as
Icelandic
Commonwealth
Swiss
Landsgemeinde
and
later
Tagsatzung
and
High
Medieval
communal
movement
linked
to
rise
of
medieval
town
privileges
and
by
modern
antimonarchism
eg
of
temporary
overthrow
of
English
monarchy
by
Parliament
of
England
in
American
Revolution
of
and
French
Revolution
of
One
of
many
opponents
of
that
trend
was
Elizabeth
Dawbarn
whose
anonymous
Dialogue
between
Clara
Neville
and
Louisa
Mills
on
Loyalty
features
silly
Louisa
who
admires
liberty
Tom
Paine
and
USA
who
is
lectured
by
Clara
on
Gods
approval
of
monarchy
and
on
influence
women
can
exert
on
men
Since
then
advocacy
of
abolition
of
monarchy
or
respectively
of
republics
has
been
called
republicanism
while
advocacy
of
monarchies
is
called
monarchism
As
such
republics
have
become
opposing
and
alternative
form
of
government
to
monarchy
despite
some
having
seen
infringements
through
lifelong
or
even
hereditary
heads
of
state
With
rise
of
republicanism
diverse
division
between
republicanism
developed
in
thcentury
politics
such
as
antimonarchist
radicalism
and
conservative
or
even
reactionary
monarchism
In
following
th
century
many
countries
abolished
monarchy
and
became
republics
especially
in
wake
of
World
War
I
and
World
War
II
Today
fortyfive
sovereign
nations
in
world
have
monarch
including
sixteen
Commonwealth
realms
that
have
Elizabeth
II
as
head
of
state
Most
modern
monarchs
are
constitutional
monarchs
who
retain
unique
legal
and
ceremonial
role
but
exercise
limited
or
no
political
power
under
constitution
Many
are
socalled
crowned
republics
surviving
particularly
in
small
states
In
some
nations
however
such
as
Brunei
Morocco
Oman
Qatar
Saudi
Arabia
Eswatini
and
Thailand
hereditary
monarch
has
more
political
influence
than
any
other
single
source
of
authority
in
state
either
by
convention
or
by
constitutional
mandate
According
to
study
monarchy
arose
as
system
of
governance
because
of
efficiency
in
governing
large
populations
and
expansive
territories
during
periods
when
coordinating
such
populations
was
difficult
The
authors
argue
that
monarchy
declined
as
efficient
regime
type
with
innovations
in
communications
and
transportation
technology
as
efficiency
of
monarchy
relative
to
other
regime
types
declined

Monarchies
are
associated

to
their

or
another

of
their

they

Most
monarchs
both
historically
and
in
modern
day
have
been
born
and
brought
up
within
royal
family
centre
of
royal
household
and
court
Growing
up
in
royal
family
called
dynasty
when
it
continues
for
several
generations
future
monarchs
are
often
trained
for
their
expected
future
responsibilities
as
monarch
Different
systems
of
hereditary
succession
have
been
used
such
as
proximity
of
blood
primogeniture
and
agnatic
seniority
Salic
law
While
most
monarchs
in
history
have
been
male
many
female
monarchs
also
have
reigned
The
term
queen
regnant
refers
to
ruling
monarch
while
queen
consort
refers
to
wife
of
reigning
king
Rule
may
be
hereditary
in
practice
without
being
considered
monarchy
there
have
been
some
family
dictatorshipsnote
and
also
political
families
in
many

The
principal
advantage
of
hereditary
monarchy
is
immediate
continuity
of
leadership
as
evidenced
in
classic
phrase
The
King

Some
monarchies
are
not
hereditary
In
elective
monarchy
monarchs
are
elected
or
appointed
by
some

Four
elective

In

In
Western
political
tradition
morally
based
balanced
monarchy
was
stressed
as
ideal
form
of
government
and
little
attention
was
paid
to
modernday
ideals
of
egalitarian
democracy
eg
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
unapologetically
declared
Tyranny
is
wont
to
occur
not
less
but
more
frequently
on
basis
of
polyarchy
rule
by
many
ie
oligarchy
or
democracy
than
on
basis
of
monarchy
On
Kingship
However
Thomas
Aquinas
also
stated
that
ideal
monarchical
system
would
also
have
at
lower
levels
of
government
both
aristocracy
and
elements
of
democracy
in
order
to
create
balance
of
power
The
monarch
would
also
be
subject
to
both
natural
and
divine
law
and
to
Church
in
matters
of

In

ancient

that
were

Furthermore
in

hundreds
of
subregional
polities
that

there
are
not
provided
for
in
current

they
are
nevertheless
legally
recognised
aspects
of

that

For

Yoruba

its

even

is
not
necessary
in

since

monarch
binds
separate

political
legitimacy
eg
in

together
Monarchies
though
have
applied
state
symbols

to
create

is
to

Elective
In
hereditary
monarchy
position
of
monarch
is
inherited
according
to
statutory
or
customary
order
of
succession
usually
within
one
royal
family
tracing
its
origin
through
historical
dynasty
or
bloodline
This
usually
means
that
heir
to
throne
is
known
well
in
advance
of
becoming
monarch
to
ensure
smooth
succession
Primogeniture
in
which
eldest
child
of
monarch
is
first
in
line
to
become
monarch
is
most
common
system
in
hereditary
monarchy
The
order
of
succession
is
usually
affected
by
rules
on
gender
Historically
agnatic
primogeniture
or
patrilineal
primogeniture
was
favoured
that
is
inheritance
according
to
seniority
of
birth
among
sons
of
monarch
or
head
of
family
with
sons
and
their
male
issue
inheriting
before
brothers
and
their
issue
and
maleline
males
inheriting
before
females
of
male
line
This
is
same
as
semiSalic
primogeniture
Complete
exclusion
of
females
from
dynastic
succession
is
commonly
referred
to
as
application
of
Salic
law
see
Terra
salica
Before
primogeniture
was
enshrined
in
European
law
and
tradition
kings
would
often
secure
succession
by
having
their
successor
usually
their
eldest
son
crowned
during
their
own
lifetime
so
for
time
there
would
be
two
kings
in
coregency
senior
king
and
junior
king
Examples
were
Henry
Young
King
of
England
and
early
Direct
Capetians
in
France
Sometimes
however
primogeniture
can
operate
through
female
line
King
Leopold
I
elected
founder
of
hereditary
monarchy
of
Belgium
In
Sweden
became
first
European
monarchy
to
declare
equal
full
cognatic
primogeniture
meaning
that
eldest
child
of
monarch
whether
female
or
male
ascends
to
throne
Other
kingdoms
such
as
Netherlands
in
Norway
in
Belgium
in
Denmark
in
and
Luxembourg
in
have
since
followed
suit
The
United
Kingdom
adopted
absolute
equal
primogeniture
subject
to
claims
of
existing
heirs

Pope
Francis
Sovereign
of
Vatican
City
State
In
elective
monarchy
monarchs
are
elected
or
appointed
by
somebody
electoral
college
for
life
or
defined
period
but
then
reign
like
any
other
monarch
There
is
no
popular
vote
involved
in
elective
monarchies
as
elective
body
usually
consists
of
small
number
of
eligible
people
Historical
examples
of
elective
monarchy
are
Holy
Roman
Emperors
chosen
by
princeelectors
but
often
coming
from
same
dynasty
and
free
election
of
kings
of
PolishLithuanian
Commonwealth
For
example
Pepin
Short
father
of
Charlemagne
was
elected
King
of
Franks
by
assembly
of
Frankish
leading
men
nobleman
Stanisaw
August
Poniatowski
of
Poland
was
elected
king
as
was
Frederick
I
of
Denmark
Germanic
peoples
also
had
elective
monarchies
Six
forms
of
elective
monarchies
exist
today
The
pope
of
Roman
Catholic
Church
who
rules
as
Sovereign
of
Vatican
City
State
is
elected
for
life
by
College
of
Cardinals
In

Military
Order
of
Malta
Prince
and
Grand
Master
is
elected
for
life
tenure
by
Council
Complete
of
State
from
within
its
members
In
Malaysia
federal
king
called
Yang
diPertuan
Agong
or
Paramount
Ruler
is
elected
for
fiveyear
term
from
among
and
by
hereditary
rulers
mostly
sultans
of
nine
of
federations
constitutive
states
all
on
Malay
peninsula
The
United
Arab
Emirates
also
chooses
its
federal
leaders
from
among
emirs
of
federated
states
Furthermore
Andorra
has
unique
constitutional
arrangement
as
one
of
its
heads
of
state
is
President
of
French
Republic
in
form
of
CoPrince
This
is
only
instance
in
world
where
monarch
of
state
is
elected
by
citizens
of
different
country
In
New

Maori
King
head

Movement
is
elected
by
council
of
Maori
elders
at
funeral
of
their
predecessor
which
is
also
where
their
coronation
takes
place
All
of
Heads

King
Movement
have
been
descendants
of
first
Maori
King
Potatau
Te

who
was
elected

in

The
current

is
King
Tuheitia
Potatau
Te

became
King
on
August
same
day
as
funeral
of
his

Te
Arikinui
Dame
Te
Atairangikaahu
first
Maori
Queen
As

as

Movement
King
Tuheitia
is
also
ex

Paramount
Chief
of
WaikatoTainui

Appointment
by
current
monarch
is
another
system
used
in
Jordan
It
also
was
used
in
Imperial
Russia
however
it
was
soon
changed
to
semiSalic
because
instability
of
appointment
system
resulted
in
age
of
palace
revolutions

They

Kingdom
of
Denmark
Grand
Duchy
of
Luxembourg
Kingdom
of

Kingdom
of
Norway
Kingdom
of

and
Kingdom
of
Sweden
are
fully
democratic
states
in
which
monarch
has
limited
or
largely
ceremonial
role
In
some
cases
there
is
Christian
religion
established
as
official
church
in
each
of
these
countries
This
is
Lutheran
form
of
Protestantism
in
Norway
Sweden
and
Denmark
while
Andorra
is
Roman
Catholic
country
Spain
Belgium
and
Netherlands
have
no
official

Luxembourg

Roman
Catholic
has
five
socalled
officially
recognised
cults
of
national
importance
Roman
Catholicism
Protestantism
Greek
Orthodoxy
Judaism
and
Islam
status
which
gives
to
those
religions
some
privileges
like
payment
of

Andorra
is
unique
among
all
existing
monarchies
as
it
is
diarchy
with
coprinceship
being
shared
by
president
of
France
and
bishop
of
Urgell
This
situation
based
on
historical
precedence
has
created
peculiar
situation
among
monarchies
as
neither
of
coprinces
is
of
Andorran
descent
one
is
elected
by
citizens
of
foreign
country
France
but
not
by
Andorrans
as
they
cannot
vote
in

European

retains
more
powersedit
The
Principality
of
Liechtenstein
and
Principality
of
Monaco
are
constitutional
monarchies
in
which
prince
retains
substantial
powers
For
example
Constitution
referendum
gave
Prince
of
Liechtenstein
power
to
veto
any
law
that
Landtag
parliament
proposes
while
Landtag
can
veto
any
law
that
Prince
tries
to
pass
The
prince
can
appoint
or
dismiss
any
elective
member
or
government
employee
However
he
is
not
absolute
monarch
as
people
can
call
for
referendum
to
end
monarchs
reign
When
Hereditary
Prince
Alois
threatened
to
veto
referendum
to
legalize
abortion
in
it
came
as
surprise
because
prince
had
not
vetoed
any
law
for
over
yearsnote
The
prince
of
Monaco
has
simpler
powers
he
cannot
appoint
or
dismiss
any
elective
member
or
government
employee
to
or
from
his
or
her
post
but
he
can
elect
minister
of
state
government
council
and
judges
Both
Albert
II
Prince
of
Monaco
and
HansAdam
II
Prince
of
Liechtenstein
are
theoretically
very
powerful
within
their
small
states
but
they
have
very
limited
power
compared
to

A
parliamentary
system
or
parliamentary
democracy
is
system
of
democratic
governance
of
state
or
subordinate
entity
where
executive
derives
its
democratic
legitimacy
from
its
ability
to
command
confidence
of
legislature
typically
parliament
and
is
also
held
accountable
to
that
parliament
In
parliamentary
system
head
of
state
is
usually
person
distinct
from
head
of
government
This
is
in
contrast
to
presidential
system
where
head
of
state
often
is
also
head
of
government
and
most
importantly
where
executive
does
not
derive
its
democratic
legitimacy
from
legislature
Countries
with
parliamentary
democracies
may
be
constitutional
monarchies
where
monarch
is
head
of
state
while
head
of
government
is
almost
always
member
of
parliament
such
as
Denmark
Norway
Japan
Malaysia
Sweden
and
United
Kingdom
or
parliamentary
republics
where
mostly
ceremonial
president
is
head
of
state
while
head
of
government
is
regularly
from
legislature
such
as
Ireland
Germany
India
Italy
and
Singapore
In
few
parliamentary
republics
such
as
Botswana
Kiribati
and
South
Africa
among
some
others
head
of
government
is
also
head
of
state
but
is
elected
by
and
is
answerable
to
parliament
In
bicameral
parliaments
head
of
government
is
generally
though
not
always
member
of
lower
house
Parliamentarianism
is
dominant
form
of
government
in
Europe
with
of
its
sovereign
states
being
parliamentarian
It
is
also
common
in
Caribbean
being
form
of
government
of
of
its
island
states
and
in
Oceania
Elsewhere
in
world
parliamentary
countries
are
less
common
but
they
are
distributed
through
all
continents
most
often
in
former
colonies
of
British
Empire
that
subscribe
to
particular
brand
of
parliamentarianism
known
as
Westminster
system

History
of
Parliamentarism
Since
ancient
times
when
societies
were
tribal
there
were
councils
or
headman
whose
decisions
were
assessed
by
village
elders
Eventually
these
councils
have
slowly
evolved
into
modern
parliamentary
system
The
first
parliaments
date
back
to
Europe
in
Middle
Ages
specifically
in
Alfonso
IX
King
of
Leon
Spain
convened
three
states
in
Cortes
of
Len
An
early
example
of
parliamentary
government
developed
in
todays
Netherlands
and
Belgium
during
Dutch
revolt
when
sovereign
legislative
and
executive
powers
were
taken
over
by
States
General
of
Netherlands
from
monarch
King
Philip
II
of
Spaincitation
needed
The
modern
concept
of
parliamentary
government
emerged
in
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
between
and
and
its
contemporary
Parliamentary
System
in
Sweden
between
and
In
England
Simon
de
Montfort
is
remembered
as
one
of
fathers
of
representative
government
for
convening
two
famous
parliaments
The
first
in
stripped
king
of
unlimited
authority
and
second
in
included
ordinary
citizens
from
towns
Later
in
th
century
Parliament
of
England
pioneered
some
of
ideas
and
systems
of
liberal
democracy
culminating
in
Glorious
Revolution
and
passage
of
Bill
of
Rights
In
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
monarch
in
theory
chaired
cabinet
and
chose
ministers
In
practice
King
George
Is
inability
to
speak
English
led
responsibility
for
chairing
cabinet
to
go
to
leading
minister
literally
prime
or
first
minister
Robert
Walpole
The
gradual
democratisation
of
parliament
with
broadening
of
voting
franchise
increased
parliaments
role
in
controlling
government
and
in
deciding
whom
king
could
ask
to
form
government
By
th
century
Great
Reform
Act
of
led
to
parliamentary
dominance
with
its
choice
invariably
deciding
who
was
prime
minister
and
complexion
of
government
Other
countries
gradually
adopted
what
came
to
be
called
Westminster
Model
of
government
with
executive
answerable
to
parliament
and
exercising
in
name
of
head
of
state
powers
nominally
vested
in
head
of
state
Hence
use
of
phrases
like
Her
Majestys
government
or
His
Excellencys
government
Such
system
became
particularly
prevalent
in
older
British
dominions
many
of
which
had
their
constitutions
enacted
by
British
parliament
such
as
Australia
New
Zealand
Canada
Irish
Free
State
and
Union
of
South
Africa
Some
of
these
parliaments
were
reformed
from
or
were
initially
developed
as
distinct
from
their
original
British
model
Australian
Senate
for
instance
has
since
its
inception
more
closely
reflected
US
Senate
than
British
House

Parliamentary
procedure
A
parliamentary
system
may
be
either
bicameral
with
two
chambers
of
parliament
or
houses
or
unicameral
with
just
one
parliamentary
chamber
A
bicameral
parliament
usually
consists
of
directly
elected
lower
house
with
power
to
determine
executive
government
and
upper
house
which
may
be
appointed
or
elected
through
different
mechanism
from
lower
house
Typesedit
Scholars
of
democracy
such
as
Arend
Lijphart
distinguish
two
types
of
parliamentary
democracies
Westminster
and
Consensus
systems
The
Palace
of
Westminster
in
London
United
Kingdom
The
Westminster
system
originates
from
British
Houses
of
Parliament
Westminster
systemedit
The
Reichstag
Building
in
Berlin
Germany
The
Consensus
system
is
used
in
most
Western
European
countries
The
Westminster
system
is
usually
found
in
Commonwealth
of
Nations
and
countries
which
were
influenced
by
British
political
tradition
These
parliaments
tend
to
have
more
adversarial
style
of
debate
and
plenary
session
of
parliament
is
more
important
than
committees
Some
parliaments
in
this
model
are
elected
using
plurality
voting
system
first
past
post
such
as
United
Kingdom
Canada
and
India
while
others
use
some
form
of
proportional
representation
such
as
Ireland
and
New
Zealand
The
Australian
House
of
Representatives
is
elected
using
instantrunoff
voting
while
Senate
is
elected
using
proportional
representation
through
single
transferable
vote
Regardless
of
which
system
is
used
voting
systems
tend
to
allow
voter
to
vote
for
named
candidate
rather
than
closed
list
Consensus
systemedit
The
Western
European
parliamentary
model
eg
Spain
Germany
tends
to
have
more
consensual
debating
system
and
usually
has
semicircular
debating
chambers
Consensus
systems
have
more
of
tendency
to
use
proportional
representation
with
open
party
lists
than
Westminster
Model
legislatures
The
committees
of
these
Parliaments
tend
to
be
more
important
than
plenary
chamber
Some
Western
European
countries
parliaments
eg
in
Netherlands
Luxembourg
and
Sweden
implement
principle
of
dualism
as
form
of
separation
of
powers
In
countries
using
this
system
Members
of
Parliament
have
to
resign
their
place
in
Parliament
upon
being
appointed
or
elected
minister
Ministers
in
those
countries
usually
actively
participate
in
parliamentary
debates
but
are
not
entitled
to
vote
Election
of
head
of
governmentedit
Implementations
of
parliamentary
system
can
also
differ
as
to
how
prime
minister
and
government
are
appointed
and
whether
government
needs
explicit
approval
of
parliament
rather
than
just
absence
of
its
disapproval
Some
countries
such
as
India
also
require
prime
minister
to
be
member
of
legislature
though
in
other
countries
this
only
exists
as
convention
The
head
of
state
appoints
prime
minister
who
will
likely
have
majority
support
in
parliament
While
in
practice
most
prime
ministers
under
Westminster
system
including
Australia
Canada
India
New
Zealand
and
United
Kingdom
are
leaders
of
largest
party
in
parliament
technically
appointment
of
prime
minister
is
prerogative
exercised
by
monarch
governorgeneral
or
president
No
parliamentary
vote
takes
place
on
who
is
forming
government
but
since
parliament
can
immediately
defeat
government
with
motion
of
no
confidence
head
of
state
is
limited
by
convention
to
choosing
candidate
who
can
command
confidence
of
parliament
and
thus
has
little
or
no
influence
in
decisioncitation
needed
The
head
of
state
appoints
prime
minister
who
must
gain
vote
of
confidence
within
set
time
Examples
Italy
Thailand
The
head
of
state
appoints
leader
of
political
party
holding
plurality
of
seats
in
parliament
as
prime
minister
For
example
in
Greece
if
no
party
has
majority
leader
of
party
with
plurality
of
seats
is
given
exploratory
mandate
to
receive
confidence
of
parliament
within
three
days
If
this
is
not
possible
then
leader
of
party
with
second
highest
seat
number
is
given
exploratory
mandate
If
this
fails
then
leader
of
third
largest
party
is
given
it
and
so
on
The
head
of
state
nominates
candidate
for
prime
minister
who
is
then
submitted
to
parliament
for
approval
before
appointment
Example
Spain
where
King
sends
proposal
to
Congress
of
Deputies
for
approval
Also
Germany
where
under
German
Basic
Law
constitution
Bundestag
votes
on
candidate
nominated
by
federal
president
In
these
casescitation
needed
parliament
can
choose
another
candidate
who
then
would
be
appointed
by
head
of
state
Parliament
nominates
candidate
whom
head
of
state
is
constitutionally
obliged
to
appoint
as
prime
minister
Example
Japan
where
Emperor
appoints
Prime
Minister
on
nomination
of
National
Diet
Also
Ireland
where
President
of
Ireland
appoints
Taoiseach
on
nomination
of
Dil
ireann
A
public
officeholder
other
than
head
of
state
or
their
representative
nominates
candidate
who
if
approved
by
parliament
is
appointed
as
prime
minister
Example
Under
Swedish
Instrument
of
Government
power
to
appoint
someone
to
form
government
has
been
moved
from
monarch
to
Speaker
of
Parliament
and
parliament
itself
The
speaker
nominates
candidate
who
is
then
elected
to
prime
minister
statsminister
by
parliament
if
absolute
majority
of
members
of
parliament
does
not
vote
no
ie
they
can
be
elected
even
if
more

No

Yes
Direct
election
by

vote
Example
Israel
where
prime
minister
was
elected
in
general
election
with
no
regard
to
political
affiliation
and
whose
procedure
can
also
be
described
as
of
semiparliamentary
system
Power
of
dissolution
and
call
for
electionedit
Furthermore
there
are
variations
as
to
what
conditions
exist
if
any
for
government
to
have
right
to
dissolve
parliament
In
some
countries
such
as
Denmark
Malaysia
Australia
and
New
Zealand
prime
minister
has
de
facto
power
to
call
election
at
will
This
was
also
case
in
United
Kingdom
until
passage
of
Fixedterm
Parliaments
Act
In
Spain
prime
minister
is
only
person
with
de
jure
power
to
call
election
granted
by
Article
of
Constitution
In
Israel
parliament
may
vote
in
order
to
call
election
or
pass
vote
of
no
confidence
against
government
Other
countries
only
permit
election
to
be
called
in
event
of
vote
of
no
confidence
against
government
supermajority
vote
in
favour
of
early
election
or
prolonged
deadlock
in
parliament
These
requirements
can
still
be
circumvented
For
example
in
Germany
in
Gerhard
Schrder
deliberately
allowed
his
government
to
lose
confidence
motion
in
order
to
call
early
election
In
Sweden
government
may
call
snap
election
at
will
but
newly
elected
Riksdag
is
only
elected
to
fill
out
previous
Riksdags
term
The
last
time
this
option
was
used
was
in
In
Greece
general
election
is
called
if
Parliament
fails
to
elect
new
head
of
state
when
his
or
her
term
ends
In
January
this
constitutional
provision
was
exploited
by
Syriza
to
trigger
snap
election
win
it
and
oust
rivals
New
Democracy
from
power
Norway
is
unique
among
parliamentary
systems
in
that
Storting
always
serves
whole
of
its
fouryear
term
Since
in
United
Kingdom
House
of
Commons
may
be
dissolved
early
only
by
vote
of
twothirds
of
its
members
or
if
vote
of
nonconfidence
passes
and
no
alternative
government
is
formed
in
next
fourteen
days
The
parliamentary
system
can
be
contrasted
with
presidential
system
which
operates
under
stricter
separation
of
powers
whereby
executive
does
not
form
part
ofnor
is
appointed
by
parliamentary
or
legislative
body
In
such
system
parliaments
or
congresses
do
not
select
or
dismiss
heads
of
governments
and
governments
cannot
request
early
dissolution
as
may
be
case
for
parliaments
There
also
exists
semipresidential
system
that
draws
on
both
presidential
systems
and
parliamentary
systems
by
combining
powerful
president
with
executive
responsible
to
parliament
for
example
French
Fifth
Republic
Parliamentarianism
may
also
apply
to
regional
and
local
governments
An
example
is
city
of
Oslo
which
has
executive
council
Byrd
as
part
of
parliamentary
system
Antidefection
lawedit
A
few
parliamentary
democratic
nations
such
as
India
Pakistan
Bangladesh
etc
have
enacted
law
which
prohibits
floor
crossing
or
switching
party
after
election
process
With
this
law
elected
representative
have
to
lose
their
seat
in
Parliament
House
if
they
defy
direction
of
party
in
any
voting
In
UK
Parliament
member
is
free
to
cross
over
to
other
side
without
being
daunted
by
any
disqualification
law
In
Canada
and
Australia
there
is
no
restraint
on
legislators
switching
sides
Advantagesedit
See
also
Presidential
system
Advantages
and
Presidential
system
Criticism
and
disadvantages
Supporters
generally
claim
three
basic
advantages
for
parliamentary
systems
Adaptability
Scrutiny
and
accountability
Distribution
of
power
Adaptabilityedit
Parliamentary
systems
like
that
found
in
United
Kingdom
are
widely
considered
to
be
more
flexible
allowing
rapid
change
in
legislation
and
policy
as
long
as
there
is
stable
majority
or
coalition
in
parliament
allowing
government
to
have
few
legal
limits
on
what
it
can
do
Due
to
firstpastpost
this
system
produces
classic
Westminster
Model
with
twin
virtues
of
strong
but
responsive
party
government
This
electoral
system
providing
strong
majority
in
House
of
Commons
paired
with
fused
power
system
results
in
particularly
powerful
Government
able
to
provide
change
and
innovate
Scrutiny
and
accountabilityedit
The
United
Kingdoms
fused
power
system
is
often
noted
to
be
advantageous
with
regards
to
accountability
The
centralised
government
allows
for
more
transparency
as
to
where
decisions
originate
from
this
directly
contrasts
with
United
States
system
with
former
Treasury
Secretary
C
Douglas
Dillon
saying
president
blames
Congress
Congress
blames
president
and
public
remains
confused
and
disgusted
with
government
in
Washington
Furthermore
ministers
of
UK
cabinet
are
subject
to
weekly
Question
Periods
in
which
their
actionspolicies
are
scrutinised
no
such
regular
check
on
government
exists
in
US
system
Distribution
of
poweredit
Parliamentary
government
has
attractive
features
for
nations
that
are
ethnically
racially
or
ideologically
divided
In
presidential
system
all
executive
power
is
vested
in
one
person
president
whereas
power
is
more
divided
in
parliamentary
system
with
its
collegial
executive
In
Lebanese
Taif
Agreement
in
order
to
give
Muslims
greater
political
power
Lebanon
moved
from
semipresidential
system
with
powerful
president
to
system
more
structurally
similar
to
classical
parliamentary
government
Iraq
similarly
disdained
presidential
system
out
of
fears
that
such
system
would
be
tantamount
to
Shiite
domination
of
large
Sunni
minority
Afghanistans
minorities
refused
to
go
along
with
presidency
as
strong
as
Pashtuns
desired
It
can
be
argued
that
power
is
more
evenly
spread
out
in
parliamentary
government
as
government
and
prime
minister
do
not
have
power
to
make
unilateral
decisions
as
entire
government
cabinet
is
answerable
and
accountable
to
parliament
Parliamentary
systems
are
less
likely
to
allow
celebritybased
politics
to
fully
dominate
society
unlike
what
often
happens
in
presidential
systems
where
namerecall
and
popularity
can
catapult
celebrity
actor
or
popular
politician
to
presidency
despite
such
candidates
lack
of
competence
and
experience
Some
scholars
like
Juan
Linz
Fred
Riggs
Bruce
Ackerman
and
Robert
Dahl
have
found
that
parliamentary
government
is
less
prone
to
authoritarian
collapse
These
scholars
point
out
that
since
World
War
II
twothirds
of
Third
World
countries
establishing
parliamentary
governments
successfully
made
transition
to
democracycitation
needed
By
contrast
no
Third
World
presidential
system
successfully
made
transition
to
democracy
without
experiencing
coups
and
other
constitutional
breakdownscitation
needed
A
World
Bank
study
found
that
parliamentary
systems
are
associated
with
less
corruption
which
is
supported
by
separate
study
that
arrived
at
same
conclusionscitation
needed
Calling
of
electionsedit
In
his
book
The
English
Constitution
Walter
Bagehot
praised
parliamentary
governments
for
producing
serious
debates
for
allowing
for
change
in
power
without
election
and
for
allowing
elections
at
any
time
Bagehot
considered
fouryear
election
rule
of
United
States
to
be
unnatural
as
it
can
potentially
allow
president
who
has
disappointed
public
with
dismal
performance
in
second
year
of
his
term
to
continue
on
until
end
of
his
fouryear
term
Under
parliamentary
system
prime
minister
that
has
lost
support
in
middle
of
his
term
can
be
easily
replaced
by
his
own
peers
Although
Bagehot
praised
parliamentary
governments
for
allowing
election
to
take
place
at
any
time
lack
of
definite
election
calendar
can
be
abused
Previously
under
some
systems
such
as
British
ruling
party
could
schedule
elections
when
it
felt
that
it
was
likely
to
retain
power
and
so
avoid
elections
at
times
of
unpopularity
Election
timing
in
UK
however
is
now
partly
fixed
under
Fixedterm
Parliaments
Act
Thus
by
shrewd
timing
of
elections
in
parliamentary
system
party
can
extend
its
rule
for
longer
than
is
feasible
in
functioning
presidential
system
This
problem
can
be
alleviated
somewhat
by
setting
fixed
dates
for
parliamentary
elections
as
is
case
in
several
of
Australias
state
parliaments
In
other
systems
such
as
Dutch
and
Belgian
ruling
party
or
coalition
has
some
flexibility
in
determining
election
date
Conversely
flexibility
in
timing
of
parliamentary
elections
can
avoid
periods
of
legislative
gridlock
that
can
occur
in
fixed
period
presidential
system
In
any
case
voters
ultimately
have
power
to
choose
whether
to
vote
for
ruling
party
or
someone
else
Disadvantages
and

Critics
of
parliamentarianism

Legislative

Legislative
flipfloppingedit
The
ability
for
strong
parliamentary

to
push

such
as
in
United
Kingdom
whilst
positive
in
allowing
rapid

eg
nationalisation

does
have
its
drawbacks
The
flipflopping

He
states
that
because

The
earliest
and
perhaps
greatest
victory
for
liberalism
was
achieved
in
England
The
rising
commercial
class
that
had
supported
Tudor
monarchy
in
th
century
led
revolutionary
battle
in
th
and
succeeded
in
establishing
supremacy
of
Parliament
and
eventually
of
House
of
Commons
What
emerged
as
distinctive
feature
of
modern
constitutionalism
was
not
insistence
on
idea
that
king
is
subject
to
law
although
this
concept
is
essential
attribute
of
all
constitutionalism
This
notion
was
already
well
established
in
Middle
Ages
What
was
distinctive
was
establishment
of
effective
means
of
political
control
whereby
rule
of
law
might
be
enforced
Modern
constitutionalism
was
born
with
political
requirement
that
representative
government
depended
upon
consent
of
citizen
subjects
However
as
can
be
seen
through
provisions
in
Bill
of
Rights
English
Revolution
was
fought
not
just
to
protect
rights
of
property
in
narrow
sense
but
to
establish
those
liberties
which
liberals
believed
essential
to
human
dignity
and
moral
worth
The
rights
of
man
enumerated
in
English
Bill
of
Rights
gradually
were
proclaimed
beyond
boundaries
of
England
notably
in
American
Declaration
of
Independence
of
and
in

of
