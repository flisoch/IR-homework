philosopherking philosopherking
first first
he he
describes describe
how how
tyrannical tyrannical
man man
develops develop
from from
democratic democratic
household household
the the
democratic democratic
man man
is be
torn tear
between between
tyrannical tyrannical
passions passion
and and
oligarchic oligarchic
discipline discipline
and and
ends end

or or
moderation moderation
to to
restrain restrain
him him
therefore therefore
his his
most most
base base
desires desire
and and
wildest wild
passions passion
overwhelm overwhelm
him him
and and
he he
becomes become
driven drive
by by
lust lust
using use
force force
and and
fraud fraud
to to

the the
tyrant tyrant
is be
both both
slave slave
to to
his his

because because
of of
this this
tyranny tyranny
is be
regime regime
with with

happiness happiness
and and
tyrant tyrant
is be
most most
unhappy unhappy
of of
all all
since since

this this
is be
first first
proof proof
that that
it it
is be

the the
third third
proof proof
follows follow
